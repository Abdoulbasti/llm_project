Golf is extremely fun and also a little complicated. For beginners, getting into golf can seem daunting. From endless terminology to etiquette, different golf clubs, and more, there’s a lot to learn. But if we can do it, so can you! We’ve compiled a list of 100 frequently asked golf questions that beginners typically ask and answered them so you can get a head start on learning this great game.

Without further ado, here are one hundred of the most common questions beginners ask about golf. These questions and answers should help prepare you for your first tee time, make you an informed buyer of golf clubs and accessories, and almost certainly guarantee your victory at golf trivia.

New to the game? Here are some of the most common questions beginners ask about golf.

To get started as a beginner golfer, you’ll need golf clubs, balls, and tees, as well as a bag to store the equipment in. You’ll also need golf shoes that won’t damage the course, appropriate golf clothing depending on the weather, a towel for cleaning your clubs, and a divot repair tool.

Remember, as a beginner, you don't need to buy the most expensive or advanced equipment. Start with the essentials and gradually add to your collection as you progress in the game.

Golfers are allowed to carry a maximum of 14 clubs in their bag per the United States Golf Association (USGA). The 14-club limit includes all types of clubs, such as drivers, woods, irons, wedges, and putters. It is up to the golfer to decide which clubs they want to include in their bag, considering their playing style, course conditions, and personal preferences.

It's worth noting that while the maximum allowed is 14 clubs, golfers are not required to carry a full set. Beginners, for example, may start with a smaller set of clubs and gradually add more as they progress in the game.

To play a round of golf, you typically need a set of golf clubs that covers various distances and shot types. At the very least, most golfers include the following in their bag: a driver, a 3-wood, a 5-wood, a 5-iron, a 7-iron, a 9-iron, a pitching wedge, a sand wedge, and a putter. This setup should allow you to play a full round of golf.

While there isn't a strict dress code at all golf courses, it's generally recommended to wear collared shirts, slacks or shorts, and golf-specific shoes or athletic shoes. Breathable, moisture-wicking clothing is recommended to help keep you cool and comfortable while out on the course. A hat is also wise to wear to help keep UV rays off your skin.

Start by positioning your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider and parallel to the target line. Distribute your weight evenly between both feet. A balanced stance allows for a stable foundation during the swing. Bend forward from the hips, maintaining a slight flex in the knees. Tilt your spine slightly away from the target, creating a slight angle with your upper body. Allow your arms to hang naturally from your shoulders. They should feel relaxed and comfortable, with a slight bend in the elbows. Place your hands on the club with a proper grip, one that feels most comfortable and natural to you as you swing.

Start with your non-dominant hand. Hold the club just above the grip with the clubface square to the ball. Position the grip diagonally across the fingers of your non-dominant hand. The club should run from the base of your little finger to just below the heel pad of your palm. Wrap your fingers around the grip, applying light pressure. Align the "V" formed by your thumb and index finger towards your dominant shoulder. This position promotes control and helps prevent the club from twisting during the swing.

With the non-dominant hand in place, place your dominant hand on the club just below the non-dominant one. You can either interlock the little finger of your dominant hand with the index and middle finger of the non-dominant hand or overlap the index finger with your little finger. The fingers of your dominant hand should wrap snugly around the club with the pad of your thumb resting on top of the grip.

Aiming a golf ball involves aligning yourself and the clubface in relation to your intended target. The proper stance and grip are instrumental in correctly aiming the golf ball. Practice aligning yourself and the clubface during your practice sessions to develop a reliable sense of aim.

The objective is to complete each hole in as few strokes as possible. The player with the lowest score at the end of the round wins the game. Though the game itself is slightly more complicated, that’s the general idea.

The basic guidelines of golf etiquette are to show consideration for others, repair divots and ball marks, keep up the pace of play, and adhere to any course-specific rules. Golf is referred to as a gentleman’s sport. As such, it’s incredibly important for beginner golfers to familiarize themselves with the finer points of golf etiquette.

There are a plethora of terms and phrases used in golf. Some of the most common terms a golfer will hear are: rough, green, hazard, bunker, par, birdie, eagle, scratch, drive, approach, chip, pitch, backswing, downswing, and more.

For a near-complete list of golf terms, check out our Glossary of Golf Terms for Beginners.

There are plenty of golfing apps available for beginners and professionals alike. GolfNow, GolfLogix, and Fairgame are just a few of the best golfing apps currently available. These apps help with everything from shot tracking to providing 3D previews of holes, club suggestions, training courses, and more.

Though some experts say it takes a beginner anywhere from six months to a year to become proficient enough to play a round, we disagree. We recommend that you get out on the course and play, even if you find yourself scoring bogeys or worse on most holes. The value lies in the experience itself, and you're likely to learn something valuable along the way, regardless of your performance. Plus, golfing is fun!

You don’t need to be a bodybuilder or Olympic-level athlete to play golf, though a basic level of fitness will certainly serve you as you play. Since a full 18-hole course involves a lot of walking, you should be fit enough to walk at least a few miles for several hours while carrying up to 30 pounds (the average weight of a full golf bag).

Cardiovascular exercises, core-strengthening exercises, and strength training can all benefit golfers. If you want to increase your fitness level and improve your golf game at the same time, incorporate the following exercises into your workout routine:

Whether you’re allowed to jam out to your favorite tunes while playing golf depends on the specific rules of the golf course you're playing at. Some golf courses allow players to listen to music using headphones or portable speakers, while others may have restrictions or prohibit it altogether.

Even if music is allowed, it's important to be considerate of other players and maintain proper golf course etiquette. Keep the volume at a reasonable level to avoid disturbing other golfers, and ensure that you're still aware of your surroundings, including golfers in your group and potential safety warnings from the course.

Here are some of the most common questions about playing golf.

On average, a round of 18 holes for a group of four golfers can take approximately 4-4.5 hours to complete. However, actual playing times might range from 3-6 hours. The time it takes to golf 18 holes can vary depending on several factors, including the number of players both in your party and on the entire course, course conditions, pace of play, and individual playing styles.

The cost of a round (often referred to as the “green fee”) really depends on where you’re playing. If you’re playing a public course, you might be able to play a full round for $30-35 while a prestigious, private golf course might charge upwards of $600 per player, not to mention membership fees.

You can absolutely go golfing by yourself! Many golfers enjoy playing solo rounds as it allows them to focus on their game, enjoy the course at their own pace, and have some peaceful time outdoors.

That depends on your motivation. If you want to hang out with your buddies and engage in some friendly competition, go golfing with a group! If you just want to get some practice in or need some alone time, golfing by yourself is totally acceptable.

Group sizes can vary depending on the specific golf course and their policies. Generally, golf courses accommodate groups ranging from individual players up to four players per group.

“Short game" refers to shots played close to or around the green. It primarily focuses on shots where the golfer needs control and precision to navigate the course and get the ball into the hole. Your short game will typically involve chipping, pitching, and putting, as well as bunker shots and greenside bump-and-run shots.

Chipping refers to short, low-trajectory shots played from close to the green. Pitching involves hitting the ball higher and with more loft than a chip shot.

Golfers use a variety of clubs, such as wedges or even irons, to hit the ball a short distance and make it land softly on the green, allowing it to roll towards the hole. Pitch shots are used when the golfer needs to carry the ball over an obstacle, such as a bunker or a mound, and have it land softly on the green.

An approach shot refers to the shot that a golfer plays from the fairway or rough with the intent of reaching the green.

A slice is a golf shot that curves out and away from your dominant hand. For right-handed players, a sliced ball will travel far to the right, while a sliced ball will travel far to the left for left-handed players. Though there are intentional slice techniques, the fade shot being the most popular, most slice shots made by casual golfers are unintentional and detrimental to your game.

A hook shot is the opposite of a slice in that the ball curves out and toward your non-dominant side. For right-handed golfers, a hook shot starts on the right side and curves sharply to the left. For left-handed golfers, a hook will start on the left side and curve sharply to the right. Hook shots typically land well clear of the intended target. A draw shot is an intentional hook-style shot that experienced golfers use to navigate around obstacles.

Both fade and draw shots are intentional curving shots that golfers use to navigate around obstacles. They are similar to hook and slice shots, respectively, as they follow similar trajectories; however, these shots are intentional and controlled. A fade travels away from your dominant side, while a draw shot travels away from your dominant side.

For many golfers, unintentional hooks and slices are caused by improper grip or swing. Adjusting your grip, changing to a more relaxed stance, and practicing your swing can all help reduce your hook and slice shots. Forgiving clubs with flexible shafts are also enormously helpful for casual golfers looking to stop hooking or slicing the ball.

If you can't find your ball within three minutes, it is considered lost, and you must play another ball from where you last played, incurring a penalty stroke.

Out of bounds is any area on the golf course that is not considered fair play, typically indicated by white flags or poles. If your ball goes out of bounds, you must play another ball from where you last played, incurring a penalty stroke.

Yes, you can stand out of bounds to make a shot as long as your ball is in bounds. As long as your ball is within the designated boundaries, you are allowed to take your stance and make your shot.

Relief refers to a situation where a player is allowed to move their ball from its original position to a new location without penalty. Typically, players can take relief when their shot is hindered by an unintended obstruction (like a sprinkler head, cart path, etc.) or abnormal course conditions (temporary puddles, etc.).

As long as it falls off without any action or influence from you, you can re-tee the ball. Different penalties apply if you accidentally knock the ball off the tee before taking your swing.

A mulligan is the term used when a player is allowed to replay a shot without counting the stroke or incurring a penalty. It's essentially a "do-over" for a shot that did not go as intended.

Mulligans aren’t actually recognized or permitted under the official rules of golf. Mulligans are more commonly associated with informal or friendly rounds of golf where players may choose to grant each other a mulligan as a courtesy or for recreational purposes.

The order of play is typically determined by a method called "honors." On the first tee, the starting order may be based on an agreed-upon rotation or a random determination such as flipping a tee or drawing straws. After the first hole, the player with the lowest score on the previous hole typically earns the honors and tees off first on the next hole. In case of a tie, honors are retained by the player who had them on the previous hole.

Though golfers have to place their ball within the tee box at the start of each hole, they don't have to put the ball on a tee. You can use a clump of dirt as a makeshift tee or even tee off straight from the grass.

Learn more: Golf Tee Size: Which Tee Length is Best for You?

Nope! You can only touch the ball without penalty when teeing up or taking the ball out of the hole. Touching the ball in other instances is permissible, but a penalty is incurred.

A shotgun start in golf refers to a method of starting a tournament or event where groups of players begin their rounds simultaneously from different holes on the course. Instead of starting from the first hole in sequential order, each group starts from a different hole assigned to them.

You know how to play, but do you know how to win?

Using a scorecard, you’ll record the hole number you’re on as well as the number of strokes you took to complete the hole. You’ll also count any penalty strokes incurred on the hole, like hitting the ball out of bounds or into a water hazard. Once you’ve completed all holes, add up your strokes (including penalty strokes) to receive your final score.

Match play and stroke play are two different scoring formats in golf. In match play, each hole is treated as a separate competition or "match" between players. The objective is to win the most individual holes throughout the round–the player that wins the most holes is the winner. Stroke play, also known as medal play, is the most common scoring format in golf. In stroke play, each player counts the total number of strokes taken over the entire round. The player with the lowest total score at the end of the round is the winner.

A score of around 100 or below on a par-72 course is generally considered good progress for a beginner golfer. As you improve your skills and gain more experience, you can work towards breaking 90, 80, and eventually shooting par or better.

Gross score represents the total number of strokes a golfer takes to complete a round, including any penalty strokes incurred. It is the raw, unadjusted score without considering a player's handicap. Net score takes a golfer's handicap into account. The net score is calculated by subtracting the player's handicap strokes from the gross score. The purpose of the net score is to provide a more equitable way of comparing scores between players with different skill levels.

A golf handicap or handicap index is a numerical score that measures a golfer's playing ability. A golf handicap represents the number of strokes a player is expected to take above or below the course's par score. The higher the handicap, the more strokes a player is allowed to subtract from their actual score to determine their net score. A lower handicap indicates a more skilled golfer who is expected to have a lower gross score.

Par represents the standard score for a hole. It is the number of strokes an accomplished golfer is expected to take to complete the hole. Par values can vary depending on the length and difficulty of the hole, with par 3 for shorter holes, par 4 for medium-length holes, and par 5 for longer holes.

Under par refers to a score that is lower than the designated par for a particular hole or the entire round. Under par scores are commonly referred to as birdies, eagles, and double eagles or albatrosses. Being under par is generally considered favorable in golf, as it indicates that a golfer is scoring better than expected on a hole or over the entire round. The lower the score, the further "under par" the golfer is, which signifies greater skill and achievement.

A birdie is achieved when a golfer completes a hole in one stroke under par. For example, scoring a 3 on a par 4 hole or a 4 on a par 5 hole would result in a birdie.

An eagle is scored when a golfer completes a hole in two strokes under par. It signifies an exceptional achievement on the hole. For instance, scoring a 2 on a par 4 hole or a 3 on a par 5 hole would result in an eagle.

An albatross or double eagle is an incredibly rare and extraordinary score achieved when a golfer completes a hole three strokes under par. This would occur, for example, by scoring a hole-in-one on a par 4 hole or by scoring a 2 on a par 5 hole.

A bogey is scored when a golfer completes a hole in one stroke over par. It indicates a slightly less favorable outcome than par. For instance, scoring a 5 on a par 4 hole or a 6 on a par 5 hole would result in a bogey.

Bogey scores are relatively common among golfers, especially on more challenging holes. They indicate that a golfer required one additional stroke to complete the hole compared to the expected par. While bogeys are not ideal, they are a part of the game and often provide opportunities for improvement on subsequent holes.

A double bogey is achieved when a golfer completes a hole in two strokes over par. It indicates a score that is two strokes higher than the expected par for the hole.

If a golfer takes three or more strokes over par on a hole, it is referred to as a triple bogey or simply as being "x" number of strokes over par, depending on the score.

The fairway on a golf course is the closely mowed and manicured strip of grass that runs between the tee box and the putting green. It is the primary playing area of a hole and is typically wider and smoother than the rough areas that flank it.

The rough refers to the areas of longer and thicker grass that flank the fairway on a golf course. It is intentionally left less maintained compared to the fairway and is designed to provide a more challenging playing condition for golfers.

The green refers to the highly manicured, smooth, and closely mowed area at the end of each hole. It is the ultimate target and final destination of a golfer's shots. The green is where the hole, or cup, is located.

A bunker, also known as a sand trap, is an area on the golf course filled with sand or fine gravel. Bunkers are strategically placed to add challenge and complexity to the game.

Yes, repairing ball marks or divots is considered courteous to fellow golfers and to the course.

Use a divot repair tool to fix any marks or divots on the green. A divot repair tool is a small tool specifically designed for repairing ball marks. Insert the prongs of the tool into the turf at the edges of the mark. Gently lift the turf with the tool, working around the edges of the mark. Once the edges are lifted, push the grass toward the center of the mark using the divot repair tool. Repeat on all sides until the mark is level with the surrounding turf. Gently smooth the repaired area with your putter or foot to ensure it is flush with the green. Avoid stomping or pressing down too hard, as this can cause more damage.

A driving range is an area where golfers can practice their full swings with various clubs, primarily focusing on distance and accuracy. A practice green, also known as a putting green or chipping green, is an area specifically designed to help golfers improve their short game skills, including putting, chipping, and pitching.

Though the best golf course in the U.S. is largely subjective, experts tend to rank Augusta National, Pebble Beach, and Pinehurst (No. 2) among the top courses in the country.

The Old Course at St. Andrews is largely considered to be the home of golf and the ultimate bucket-list golf course for golfers around the world. Augusta National, home of the Masters Tournament, is probably a close second in fame.

The Old Course at St. Andrews Links in St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, is widely recognized as the oldest golf course in the world. The exact origins of the Old Course are unclear, but it has been played on since the early 15th century.

Several factors contribute to golf course difficulty.  Well-designed courses often incorporate strategic elements that demand thoughtful shot placement and strategic decision-making. Number of bunkers and water hazards can increase course difficulty, as can the size of the rough compared to the fairway, the slope of the course, elevation changes, and more.

A full-sized golf course consists of 18 holes.

Par 3 courses are shorter in length and feature predominantly par-3 holes. They are designed to be more beginner-friendly, providing a less intimidating and time-efficient golfing experience. Par 3 courses are ideal for practicing short game skills or golfers looking for a quick round.

A links course is a traditional seaside course located along coastal areas. It features sandy dunes, natural grasses, firm conditions, and strategic bunkering. Links courses are known for their unique playing characteristics and are often associated with Scottish and Irish golf.

A parkland course is typically located inland and is characterized by a more manicured and lush environment. These courses are often set within park-like settings with mature trees, well-maintained fairways, and defined rough.

Desert courses are found in arid regions and take advantage of the natural desert landscape. They feature rugged terrain, native desert plants, and sparse vegetation. Desert courses often require strategic shot placement and careful consideration of hazards such as desert scrub, rocks, and arroyos.

Mountain courses are built in hilly or mountainous regions, offering stunning views and challenging playing conditions. These courses feature elevation changes, sloping fairways, and undulating greens.

Your questions about golf clubs answered.

The sweet spot on a golf club refers to the area on the clubface where the ideal impact occurs between the ball and the club. When you hit a ball with the sweet spot of the club, it results in optimal energy transfer, generating maximum distance, accuracy, and a satisfying feel.

In golf, bounce refers to a design feature of golf clubs, particularly wedges. It is the angle between the leading edge of the club's sole (the bottom part of the club head) and the lowest point on the sole. Bounce helps prevent the club from digging too deeply into the ground or sand when making a shot, especially on soft turf or in sand bunkers.

Drivers are generally used for hitting long shots, like teeing off on a hole. You might also use a driver when hitting fairway shots on particularly long holes.

Sand wedges are one of the best clubs for any golfer, especially beginners and high-handicappers. As the name indicates, sand wedges are perfect for getting out of bunkers; they can also hit chip shots, half shots, and shots up to 90-100 yards.

A pitching wedge is often used for approach shots to the green when you are within the range of 100 to 125 yards. Pitching wedges are also great for chip or bump-and-run shots.

A gap wedge can achieve distances of 90-120 yards. Gap wedges are perfect for shots where you need distance, loft, and bounce. Many golfers reach for a gap wedge when they want the golf ball to get more airborne than a pitching wedge can achieve.

Lob wedges are perfect for short, high shots that have very little bounce. Shots hit with a lob wedge travel 60-90 yards on average, which makes this wedge great for controlled shots you need to hit over a feature or stop quickly once they land.

In our expert opinion, the pitching wedge and sand wedge are the best wedges for beginners to carry and the easiest wedges to learn.

Learn more: What Wedges Should a Beginner Golfer Carry?

Fairway woods are often used for tee shots on longer par 4 and par 5 holes where distance is important, but accuracy is also necessary. Additionally, if you find yourself in trouble, such as being in the rough or behind obstacles, fairway woods can be handy for recovery shots.

In general, a driver will hit the ball the farthest, up to 300 yards depending on a golfer’s swing speed. The 3-wood comes in second, with golfers hitting shots up to 215 yards.

Learn more: What is The Average Distance for Each Golf Club?

The different golf club numbers correspond to the loft angles of the clubfaces, which influence the trajectory and distance of shots.

Shaft flex refers to how flexible the shaft of a particular golf club is. Most golf clubs can be customized to have a stiff, regular, or active flex. Shaft flex influences the power and accuracy of your swing.

Learn more: Stiff vs. Regular Flex: Which Golf Shaft is Right for You?

Golf club length, or shaft length, refers to the height of your golf club. The standard club length for most manufacturers is 45 inches for drivers and around 35 inches for irons, putters, and wedges; however, this length can be adjusted to your height so you can play comfortably and effectively.

Learn more: Golf Club Length: Which Size is Right for You?

Golf clubs are usually made out of a combination of different materials. Drivers and fairway woods, for example, typically use titanium or composite materials for the club head, while irons and wedges use steel for the club head. Golf club shafts can be made of either steel or graphite.

With regular play, a brand new set of clubs can last anywhere from 3 to 10 years. Significant wear and tear is a clear sign to replace your clubs, as is a plateau in your progress.

Learn more: How Long Do Golf Clubs Last? When Should You Replace Them?

Game-improvement clubs are usually geared toward beginner or high-handicap players. These clubs include a high degree of forgiveness which helps with both accuracy and distance.

Steel shafts are heavier and provide more stability and control. They are preferred by many experienced golfers who seek accuracy and a consistent ball flight, whereas graphite shafts are preferred by beginner golfers. Graphite shafts are lighter and more flexible, providing increased clubhead speed, distance, and a smoother feel.

Deciding whether to buy new or used golf clubs depends on your budget as well as how often you plan on playing. If you plan on playing infrequently or have a low starting budget, buying a set of gently-used golf clubs is a great idea.

The price of golf clubs can vary significantly from brand to brand. Golf club sets can cost upwards of $2000 and more for high-end sets or $250 for cheap sets. Single clubs have wide price ranges as well. A premium driver from a big golf brand might run you $600-800, whereas generic box stores might carry drivers for $50.

Women’s clubs are typically shorter, more lightweight, and more flexible than men’s clubs. However, these specifications are based on generalizations and don’t factor in an individual’s abilities.

Every golfer needs a golf bag. How else are you going to carry all that gear?

Organize the clubs in your golf bag by placing the longest clubs closer to the straps and the shortest clubs toward the front. This makes your bag easier to carry and helps you grab the clubs you need quickly while playing.

Professionals end up carrying around 9-10 golf balls for an 18-hole course. However, beginners and high-handicappers (who tend to lose balls more frequently than the pros do) should carry around twelve or so for good measure.

Ten tees should be plenty for a full 18 holes, though you could probably get away with carrying a full pack in your golf bag.

You can’t play without a golf ball! Learn more about this key piece of the game.

The dimples on a golf ball are carefully designed to maximize lift, reduce drag, optimize spin, and enhance stability. Dimples greatly impact the maximum distance, accuracy, and overall performance of a golf ball.

The core of a golf ball is usually made of synthetic rubber or a mixture of rubber compounds, the mantle layer is typically made of materials such as synthetic rubber or thermoplastic materials, and the cover of a golf ball is typically made from surlyn or urethane.

The right golf ball can influence your game. Soft golf balls are best for players with slower swing speeds (under 90 MPH) and provide better spin and loft than hard golf balls. Hard golf balls are best for players with fast swing speeds (100 MPH and greater) and provide more roll distance.

Learn more: Soft vs. Hard Golf Balls: What Golf Ball Should You Use?

A low spin golf ball is a two-piece ball with a hard cover compared to other balls. Low spin golf balls reduce backspin, resulting in a longer and straighter flight, which makes them great for golfers that hit high and slice or hook shots frequently.

Miscellaneous golf questions for curious trivia lovers.

Yes! Golf is a part of the Summer Olympics.

The origins of golf are believed to trace back to Scotland. The game's early development took place in the 15th century, with evidence of golf-like activities being played in various forms throughout Scotland during that time. While the exact origins are not fully documented, it is widely accepted that Scotland played a significant role in the evolution of the sport, with St. Andrews often referred to as the home of golf.

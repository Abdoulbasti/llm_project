I’m not talking about pace of play, or penalties or anything like that, I’m talking about the stuff that most people won’t even correct you on because it’s not that big of a deal, but you should probably know.

For example, is there a proper place to stand while someone is teeing off? Is okay to stand behind them on the tee box taking practice swings?

Is it okay to drive your cart to your ball if it’s further up than someone in your group, or are you supposed to wait?

What about putting? Are you supposed to stand in a particular place? Is it okay to be walking while someone is putting?

Is there a correct order to tee off in or putt in, or is ready golf the way to go?

The point here is that a lot of people don’t know what they don’t know, so here’s your opportunity to tell them.

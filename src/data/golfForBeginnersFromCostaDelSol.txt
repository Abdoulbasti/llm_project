Costa del Golf is packed with over 70 golf courses and clubs, as well as a pleasant climate that lets golf lovers play golf any day of the year. If you’ve never played golf before, there are some rules and terms you should become familiar with. Check them out below, then schedule a lesson or a round of golf on the Costa del Golf!

In golf, the amount of points you get directly correlates to the number of strokes it takes you to get the ball in the hole. The fewer strokes you take, the better. At the end of each hole, each player tallies the number of strokes he or she took on that hole. At the end of all the holes, the player that took the least amount of strokes wins.

Don’t start a game without first making sure you’ve chosen a course that meets your skill level. Here’s a quick guide to the four different types of courses:

Red: Beginning female golfers (basic and intermediate)

Blue: Competition-level women (advanced)

Yellow: Beginning male golfers (basic and intermediate)

White: Competition-level golfers (advanced; male and female)

There are different kinds of golf tees: wooden tees, plastic stepped tees (12 mm, 24 mm or 37 mm), one-tees and little one-tees. Tees can only be used at the start of each hole. You have to figure out the right height of the tee, where the ball should be placed and where you need to stand in relation to the tee. If the tee is too low, you risk hitting just the top of the ball, which won’t get you very far. If your tee is too high, you’ll hit the ball from the bottom, thus sending it straight into the air and reducing how far out the ball could actually travel.

This sport requires concentration, so silence and stillness are key when someone is at the tee. Give players plenty of space and avoid moving around as much as possible. Your best bet is to stand across from the player who is at the tee so that you can see where his or her ball lands once it’s hit.

Within a hole, the player who hit the ball farthest goes first.

90% of the balls used are white, but all of them are numbered. Before you start, look at the number on your ball and write it down. You can also mark your ball or choose a ball that’s a different colour from your opponents so you don’t get confused.

If you hit a ball outside the limits of the course, play a second ball. The first hit will be counted as a penalty stroke.

If your ball has fallen behind a tree, in a bush or somewhere else you can’t access, you have two options: you can move the ball a distance of two golf clubs from where it is (but not in the direction that’s closer to the hole) or you can grab a new ball and hit it again from the starting point of your last shot. Both options will result in a penalty stroke.

When you hit your ball in a sand bunker, you have two options. If the ball is still playable, try to hit it out of the bunker! If it can’t be played, use the same guidelines as in the above point. As a courtesy, rake the sand to smooth it out when you’re done.

You have two options! If you’re in the part of the course with the red pegs, you can replay the ball from the point of the previous shot, move the ball along the line between the obstacle’s entry point and the flag (but not towards the flag) or move the ball a distance of two clubs from where the ball entered the obstacle. A penalty stroke will be taken for either choice. If the water hazard is in the centre part of the course or the part with the yellow pegs, you can move the ball along the line between the obstacle’s entry point and the flag (but not towards the flag) or go back and re-hit the previous shot. A penalty stroke will be taken for either choice.

Being on the green comes with specific rules. They are:

A hole is always started by the player who won the previous hole.

Now that you know the basics, it’s time to play! When you play golf on the Costa del Golf, you’ll have access to a range of professionals who can answer any questions you may have. (For example: What golf club should you use? Or, how can you improve your swing? It’s normal for amateur golfers to have questions—so don’t hesitate to ask!).

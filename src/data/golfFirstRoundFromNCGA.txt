Golf is hard, we know. It’s even harder to get into if you don’t know some of those unspoken rules and traditions that govern a round of golf. We all start somewhere, why not here with this list of more in-depth practical advice that goes beyond just what to wear on the course? (but FYI, it's best to call the course ahead of time if you have questions on attire🤔)

Prepare to delve into some unexpected questions (complete with answers!) that will guide you through your first golfing journey, so you can walk the golf walk with confidence and avoid any rookie mistakes along the way!

Quick Take: Your first round is about fun, not perfection. Here’s what to expect, how to prepare, and how to avoid common rookie mistakes.

You are golf course ready if you can confidently check off all items in the list below:

Here are some before you arrive at the golf course, “good to knows”:

7-Iron Distance

Best Course Length

80 yards or less

3,500 - 3,700

95

4,100 - 4,300

110

4,800 - 5,000

125

5,400 - 5,600

140

5,900 - 6,100

155

6,400 - 6,600

170 or more

6,700 - 6,900

Playing from tees that match your skill level keeps the game fun and builds confidence right away.

For example: according to the above table, if you hit your 7-iron 95 yards, it's recommended that you play the Green tees at Poppy Hills Golf Course since the total course length (denoted on the scorecard below) is 4,173 yards.

Here are a few things to consider when scoring your round:

It’s okay to pre-determine how you want to play your round. Simply inform your playing partners that this is your inaugural round, and they will be more than willing to accommodate your preferences. Just be sure that your play isn’t disruptive to their round.

Some perfectly acceptable first round ideas include:

Your first round isn’t about your score — it’s about learning the game, enjoying the experience, and wanting to come back.

Q: Do I need to know all the rules?A: No. Focus on etiquette, safety, and pace. You’ll learn the rest.Q: What should I wear?A: Collared shirt, comfortable shoes, and bring water/sunscreen. Many courses rent clubs if you don’t own any.Q: How long will it take?A: About 2–3 hours for 9 holes, 4–5 hours for 18 (sometimes more your first time).Q: Can I post my first round for a Handicap Index?A: Yes, if it meets WHS conditions. NCGA membership gives you GHIN access to post scores.Q: What’s the #1 mistake beginners make?A: Playing from back tees. Start forward for more fun and less frustration.

Just like entering a crowded gym for the first time (or returning after the New Year's rush), playing your first round of golf can feel like all eyes are on you, analyzing your every swing. However, rest assured that every golfer out there is primarily focused on their own game, not yours.

Take a deep breath, enjoy the walk, and remember — every golfer started somewhere. Your first round is the beginning of a lifetime game.

Hopefully this list helps ease that pre-round anxiety that only starting a new hobby like golf can trigger. Be sure to pass along these valuable insights to fellow beginners in your golfing circle to help them feel more at ease when stepping onto the course for the first time.

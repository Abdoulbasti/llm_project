Looking for the perfect place to practice your game? Enjoy a welcoming course that’s great for beginners and seasoned golfers alike.

Golf is a great hobby and a fantastic excuse to get outside and breathe some fresh air once in a while.

However, there is a common perception of golf being an uptight and inaccessible activity.

Because of that, a lot of people get frightened away and don’t ever try it for themselves out of fear that they don’t know the golf etiquette for beginners, and don’t know who to ask about it.

Basically, they just don’t want to cause a fuss.

This is very unfortunate because so many of those people would love it if they gave it a chance.

And the fact that they’re worried about others is exactly why they’d be great people to have on a course.

So, we’re writing this article for those people, and for you.

We’re here to tell you that there’s really not much to worry about, and most of your fears are only based on misunderstandings and misconceptions.

As long as you have a positive attitude and you follow these tips on golf etiquette for beginners, you’ll have a great time.

And maybe you’ll even become a lifelong golfer yourself.

You’re new, and that’s ok.

Everyone has a first time, and everyone’s new for a while.

That’s how it works.

But for some people, it’s been a long time since they were new.

And they might also be rushing to try to get a game in before a meeting or some other commitment they have.

So, it’s always appreciated if you are considerate of them by…

This is a way to get an edge on the competition, but, more importantly, it’s a way to show respect for everyone else’s time.

If you arrive early and get your warmup in before the official start time for your game, you won’t need to do it after everyone has already arrived.

Better still, you’ll be more relaxed and limbered up by the time they get there.

It’s ok.

You’re on the golf course to relax, and you’re probably not in a rush.

There’s no point in arguing over who has the right of way or forcing people who are clearly plowing through the course faster than you to wait behind you on every hole.

Take things easy and just invite them to quickly play through the hole that you’re on so that they’ll be ahead of you from then on, and it won’t be an issue.

Of all the things on this list, this is one of the most important fundamentals of golf etiquette for beginners.

And following it will ensure that you have no problems with anyone who is behind you.

Once again, you’re here to have fun and relax.

And hopefully you’re not playing for high stakes like money or anything.

While we wouldn’t recommend gambling anyway, we especially wouldn’t recommend it while you’re still new and unskilled.

But yeah, don’t feel like you have to be a professional and get everything right.

Just relax and swing. 🏌️

A lot of people forget this, but it’s very helpful for you and everyone else playing to mark your ball with a marker or identify it in some other way.

It’s also courteous to inform everyone what type of balls you’re using.

This not only makes it easier to identify each person’s ball, but it also shows good faith because not all balls are created equal.

Some aren’t even tournament legal.

This is both essential to golf etiquette for beginners and also a safety rule.

Just like when you’re trying to hit the ball, other players don’t want to have anyone standing too close to them or have their vision obstructed in any way while they’re hitting.

Keeping your distance from the person who is hitting also protects you from accidentally getting whacked with a golf club.

This one generally requires that you have a ball divot repair tool.

These are relatively cheap, and you can buy one online.

But be sure not to cheap out and buy some flimsy made-in-China thing that’s going to break within the first ten uses.

Buy a quality one from a good brand and learn how to use it properly by reading the instructions and maybe watching a tutorial or two on YouTube.

This is easy enough to do, and can be as relaxing as raking the sand in a zen garden.

Like everything else in golf, it can be a relaxing ritual.

In fact, most aspects of golf seem to have been designed to be relaxing rituals.

If you’ve been paying attention, you may be noticing that the primary root of golf etiquette for beginners is to show consideration for whoever is behind you.

Another straightforward way to do this is by putting the flag sticks back into the holes before you move on to the next hole.

This requires almost no effort on your part, but it makes someone else’s experience on the course better.

One of the main reasons people play golf is to get out into nature (or at least a manicured version of it) and relax with a low-intensity game.

That’s probably a big part of why you’re out there, too.

So be part of making that atmosphere soothing by being mindful of your volume.

Don’t yell, cheer, or talk too loudly.

And if you want to celebrate or congratulate someone (good sportsmanship is always great), learn to master the subtle art of the golf clap.

As we said at the beginning of this article, golf is a fantastic sport.

It can be enjoyed by people of all ages and even people who are not physically able to compete in other, more aggressive sports.

So while you’re new now, you could easily still be playing regularly for the rest of your life.

You can even teach your kids and grandkids, so you can always have a shared activity to bond with the whole family over.

And as long as you follow these rules of golf etiquette for beginners, you’ll have a wonderful time and be a joy to everyone else around you.

Golf is an exciting sport that enjoys great popularity around the world. However, for many beginners, the rules of the game can seem like a complex and daunting maze. Don’t worry, in this article we will guide you through the 5 basic rules that every player should know to start enjoying golf to the fullest.

The main objective of golf is to complete an 18-hole course using the fewest strokes possible. Each hole has an assigned par, which represents the number of strokes an average player should need to complete it. The player who completes the course with the fewest total strokes wins the game.

To play golf, you will need a set of golf clubs, a golf ball, and a tee. Golf clubs are used to hit the ball, and each one has a specific function. The golf ball is a small white sphere that is hit with the clubs. The tee is a small piece of plastic or wood that is placed on the ground to elevate the ball before the first shot of each hole.

In golf, each stroke a player makes is counted. At the end of each hole, the player adds up the number of strokes they have used and writes their score on a scorecard. The player with the lowest total score at the end of the course wins the game.

Golf is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. With a little practice and knowledge of the basic rules, you will be well on your way to becoming a successful golfer.

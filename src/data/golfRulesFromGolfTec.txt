Golf improvement doesn’t have to be complicated. OPTIMOTION was built to replace confusion with clarity and guesswork with data.

OPTIMOTION captures and analyzes full-body swing data in real time—no wires, no sensors—using dual cameras and the world’s largest golf swing database of over 14 million swings.

As the cornerstone of GOLFTEC's inctruction, OPTIMOTION has spanned three decades of innovation. OPTIMOTION has evolved from early motion capture systems into a cutting-edge, sensorless technology that powers personalized swing improvement, and is now seen on live tour coverage.

Track critical body movements like hip sway, shoulder turn, and more—at every stage of your swing, from address to follow-through.

Live swing video overlays give you immediate visual feedback, helping you connect what you feel with what’s actually happening in your swing.

Compare your swing side-by-side with tour pros to pinpoint key differences and learn what better looks—and moves—like.

Review your swings with your coach’s analysis whenever you need it— each OPTIMOTION session is saved in your Student Clubhouse, complete with video, data, and commentary to help you reinforce key takeaways.

Understand your swing inside and out and see the numbers behind the change.

OPTIMOTION has been featured on major networks and the TOUR breaking down pro golfers.

The path to improvement just got a whole lot quicker with insights from Optimotion.

OPTIMOTION is GOLFTEC’s proprietary motion measurement technology that analyzes your golf swing in 3D using just two cameras—no markers or sensors needed. It provides data on key swing elements like shoulder turn, hip sway, and posture to help you and your Coach make precise, personalized improvements.

You can practice with OPTIMOTION during your GOLFTEC lessons and practice sessions at a GOLFTEC Training Center. As you swing, OPTIMOTION captures real-time data and visuals to help you track key improvements like body movement, swing consistency, and posture. Your Coach will use this feedback to guide your practice and reinforce proper mechanics.

Yes! You can review your swings anytime in the Student Clubhouse. Each swing includes your Coach’s analysis and motion data, so you can revisit key points and track your progress between lessons.

OPTIMOTION has been featured in live golf broadcasts to break down professional swings in real time. Broadcasters use the technology to show 3D visuals of a player's movement—like hip sway, shoulder turn, and spine angle—helping viewers better understand what makes each swing effective.

OPTIMOTION analyzes key body movement metrics throughout your swing, including shoulder turn, hip sway, bend, knee flex, and more. These insights help identify the root cause of swing issues and guide your Coach in making personalized, data-driven improvements.

GOLFTEC stands out as the leader in golf instruction by combining certified coaching, cutting-edge technology, and a data-driven approach to help golfers see measurable improvement.

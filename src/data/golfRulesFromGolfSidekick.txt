Golfers love rules and some guys can be real sticklers for them. By that, I mean they have arguments and carry a pocket rule book to prove they're right over the tiniest of innocent infringements. That's a minority of guys but generally we all like to play by the book as best we can.

I've summarized the basic rules of golf for beginners most to ensure you don't commit any mortal sins on the course. If you follow these basics, you'll be invited back! In the beginning, it's intimidating, but most people will understand you're new but learn the basic rules of golf and you're set for your journey.

Note that I'm covering the rules for strokeplay. That means you count all your shots and must put the ball in the hole to complete the hole. Matchplay is a different form of the game, but I promise, you'll only need to know those rules about 2 years after you start playing.

If any part of the ball is touching the green, it means you're on the green and can put a marker behind the ball and pick it up to clean. Well done!

You can take a look at the full rules of golf at the USGA and R&A websites.

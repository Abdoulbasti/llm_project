==================================================

Hey so i’m looking to regrip my clubs and was just looking to hear some feedback on the feel and durability of different models. I played the tour wrap midsize last year, which i thought was solid but on the really humid days i felt my hands slipping no matter what even if i rubbed it with a towel right before (tried cleaning them too and it didn’t improve much). that being said im looking at the MCC and tour velvet models now. I was planning on using the MCC grips because of the humidity, and on top of that I already get sweaty palms. but i bought new irons that came with MCC grips in standard size (club customization was unavailable at purchase so the irons came with stock shafts and grips) and don’t love the grips. i know the are a firmer feel but coming off the tour wrap it’s quite the change.

That brings me to my final question. should i try the tour velvet or try mcc midsize grip? of course i can go into my local store and try them both im just looking for some user feedback.

Details in our Privacy Policy Knowing the golf rules is essential for any new player stepping onto the course. These regulations, set by organizations such as Golf Canada and the R&A, create fairness and enjoyment for everyone involved. The basic rules of golf ensure consistency in competitions and friendly matches. Beginners who understand the guidelines are more confident, respect fellow players, and feel welcome. Learning the rules allows players to develop their skills while staying within the spirit of the game. It is not just about compliance—it is about making each round more enjoyable and cultivating a lifelong appreciation for golf. Mastering beginner golf rules is the first step toward a rewarding golfing journey. The first rule of golf lays the foundation. Players must “play the course as you find it and play the ball as it lies.” This principle reflects the tradition and challenge of the game. Golfers are expected not to improve their ball’s position or alter the landscape around them, whether in the rough, on the fairway, or in a bunker. Course etiquette also means repairing divots and pitch marks, raking bunkers after use, and keeping noise and distractions to a minimum. Respect for the course and other golfers fosters enjoyment and maintains course conditions for all. Following this core rule sets the stage for a positive golf experience. Two major formats exist in golf competition rules: match play and stroke play. In match play, holes are won, lost, or halved, and the player or team with the most holes won wins the match. For instance, being “3 up with 2 to play” means victory is secured. Stroke play sees every stroke count, and the lowest cumulative total over the round wins. Beginners should learn how to score in both situations. Recording one’s strokes accurately, especially in stroke play, is key to playing correctly. Understanding these formats ensures players can join any round confidently. Golfers are allowed a maximum of 14 clubs per round. Bringing more than this leads to penalty strokes or disqualification. Players must also use conforming equipment, as outlined in the rules. Each hole should be played with the same golf ball unless the rules permit a change, such as when a ball becomes damaged or is lost. Golf Canada lists approved golf balls and golf clubs, and starter complete sets are available to meet every player’s requirements. Following equipment rules keeps play fair and competitive from the start. Every golf shot counts. Each time the ball is struck, it is a stroke, and the sum for each hole forms the player's score. The lowest total wins in stroke play, while match play focuses on winning individual holes. Penalties for rule violations or lost balls add strokes. The “10 shot rule” sometimes serves to limit a player’s maximum number of strokes on a hole to ten—this is common in beginner tournaments to speed up play and keep morale high. An understanding of scoring, as well as terms like eagle, birdie, par, bogey, and double bogey, will help beginners follow and record scores accurately. Always mark scores hole by hole and use approved golf balls to ensure compliance. Check out also our blog about golf ball rollback to view the updated rules on the subject. Preparation sets the tone for a successful round. Players must know their starting time and arrive early to check in, warm up, and review course conditions. Wearing proper golf apparel and golf shoes is key for comfort and compliance. Maintaining pace—playing at the group’s speed and being ready for each shot—keeps the game moving. Pre-round practice is restricted to certain areas; always follow posted rules on when and where to hit warm-up shots. Efficient play, respect for scheduled tee times, and readiness at each hole are signs of a considerate golfer. Penalties ensure adherence to the golf rules, but they are fair and clearly defined. One of the most common involves a lost ball or hitting out of bounds. In these scenarios, players must use the "stroke-and-distance" rule: replay the shot from the spot of the previous stroke and add a penalty stroke. Announcing and playing a provisional ball prevents delays. If a rule is violated, follow established steps to resolve it—determine the breach, apply penalties, and proceed. Carrying more than 14 clubs, moving a ball in play, or teeing from outside the markers are other violations. Understanding how to apply and accept penalties allows play to continue smoothly. Read also: What is Golf Handicap? Penalty areas include water hazards (marked by either yellow or red stakes) and bunkers. When a ball enters a penalty area, players may either play it as it lies or use relief options. Relief can include dropping the ball back from the hazard’s edge (with a penalty stroke) or dropping within two club-lengths from the point of last crossing—but never closer to the hole. In bunkers, players can take penalty relief outside the hazard if a ball is unplayable. Knowing golf accessories like ball markers and measuring tools helps when assessing relief. Typical scenarios include a ball rolling into water or an embedded ball in a bunker. Quick and confident action, while following rules, can turn a disadvantage into a manageable situation. For beginners, mastering the basic rules of golf is crucial for enjoyment, skill development, and fair competition. Understanding course etiquette, scoring, equipment rules, penalties, and relief options builds confidence and improves overall experiences. With practice, the rules become second nature, creating a smoother path into friendly matches or competitive play.

Perhaps no sport can be more intimidating for beginners than golf. If you’re fortunate, you have a mentor to help you in the beginning, to walk you through some of the basics of golf etiquette, like how and where to stand on the tee and the green, how to keep up pace of play, and simply how to make sure your playing companions are comfortable playing with you. Forty years ago when I first started playing golf, I had such a mentor. I can still remember him finally pulling me aside after a few rounds and explaining to me how I constantly walked on other golfer’s putting lines. I wasn’t aware that was a problem, of course, but more on that a little later. Here, then, are a 15 tips on proper etiquette on the golf course. Not to be confused with the Rules of Golf, most of this is simply understood as a courtesy to your playing companions and, quite frankly, the rest of the players on the course as well. Here, we cover everything from the tee to the green and even the golf cart. Unlike tennis, where there’s nothing you can do on the court before your appointed court time, golf doesn’t begin at your tee time, it begins in the parking lot. This means you need to arrive early, at least a half hour or more, depending on how much you want to practice, or perhaps grab a snack or a beverage. It begins with dropping off your clubs at bag drop or taking them from your trunk to the course, putting on your golf shoes, and checking into the shop. If you plan on hitting range balls, you need to factor that in as well. And you should be at the first tee at least 10 minutes before your tee time to check in with the starter. If you wait until the last minute to show up, you’re not only stressing yourself out, but the rest of the players in your group as well. So you’ve made it to the first tee on the golf course. Where should you stand? The better question might be where shouldn’t you stand. Individual golfers have their own quirks and pet peeves, but generally you don’t want to be anywhere in front of the player teeing off or in the player’s line of vision. So directly across from the player (the same line as the ball) is probably not a good idea, and many players don’t like it when someone is directly behind them. The one exception to the latter might be when the golfer is teeing off into the sun, so you can help the player locate the ball after it’s hit. Also important: try not to move while the player is swinging, and no talking. And it doesn’t bother every golfer, but sitting in your golf cart while the others are hitting tee shots can be considered rude, too, so it’s always best to watch the other players shots and even encourage them. In casual golf, Ready Golf has certainly become the custom, meaning that playing out of order is fine as long as you are not impeding another player. (Tradition has always been that the player farthest away from the hole go first, but that can often slow down play.) If you’re ready to hit, go for it. The one exception is on the tee when one of the players in your group has made birdie or eagle on the previous hole. In this case, it’s always preferable, even if that player isn’t ready, to say “birdie goes first,” at least making the offer. This will drive serious golfers nuts. Don’t use the course as a driving range. So you hit a bad shot. As long as it’s findable or not out of bounds, don’t hit another one. It slows everybody down, and there’s nothing worse than having to look for two balls from one player when it’s totally unnecessary. If you make a divot (creating a crater in the ground with your club), either replace it or fill it with provided sand. Different courses have different rules depending on the type of turf (replace or fill). Also, if you make a pitch mark on the green with your approach shot, be sure to repair it with a tee or ball mark repair tool. You don’t always have to mark your ball on the green, but you should if it interferes with another player’s putting line, whether that’s on the way to the hole or even behind it (your ball can be a distraction, and it’s a penalty if another player’s ball contacts yours. The best way to mark is with a coin or round dedicated ball marker, by placing it directly behind your ball, then lift your ball. When you putt, try to replace your ball in the exact same location and then remove the mark. Also, be aware of where you stand on the green when another player is putting. Stay out of the player’s direct line of site if you can. Now that the Rules of Golf allow you to leave the flagstick in the cup, you don’t always need to pull it while putting. It’s become a preference one way or another for most players. Still, if you do pull it, lay it down on the green where it doesn’t interfere with play. Also golf etiquette generally calls for the first player to putt out to grab the flagstick and return it to the cup when everyone finishes on the green. While many golf shoes these days are spikeless (this isn’t as big a deal as it used to be with metal spikes), it’s still good etiquette to avoid walking on your fellow competitors’ putting lines (the path that a player’s ball will use to travel to the cup). The reason is because you could cause indentations or marks that could alter the path of their putts. It’s also a good practice not to walk on the through-lines, which are the possible path a player might have back to the cup is a putt runs past the hole. Keeping things moving is a common theme to good golf etiquette, so here are some more guidelines: Don’t take excessive practice swings. One or two should be plenty. And be ready to hit or putt when it’s your turn. Try to gather as much information as you can while other players are hitting their shots, i.e., yardages, how a putt breaks, wind, etc. Never do this by the green you just played. You should clear the area as soon as possible so the group behind you can hit their approach shots. And there will be plenty of time on the next tee to record scores while your fellow competitors are hitting their tee shots. Nobody likes seeing someone waiting for the group on the green to clear from 275 yards out when that golfer only hit a 200-yard drive. But by the same token, if you think you can reach the green or get near it with a good shot, you should wait, both in terms of safety and disturbing the group on the green. The same is especially true when teeing off. Make sure the group in front of you has moved out of your range. Everyone who has played golf for a while has experienced someone hitting into them. It’s both scary and rude. Unless you’re playing in a tournament where every stroke is counted, if a hole gets out of hand, you don’t have to finish it. Making a 12 on a hole will not affect your handicap any more than making a 7 or 8, so to keep everything moving, it’s OK and preferable to put your ball in your pocket and move on. Where to drive your golf cart for a beginner isn’t a given. Most courses have rules about how close to the green (usually no closer than 50 yards) you can drive a cart, and you should rarely leave the path for par 3 holes. When carts are allowed in the fairways, many have a 90-degree rule, meaning you should stay on the cart path until you’re even with your ball or your playing companion’s ball, then drive over. The idea is to limit potential damage to the course. Also, be cognizant about locking the break while someone else is taking a stroke. An ill-timed noise from the cart can cause another player to flinch. A more recent phenomena in golf are the portable speakers people like to take out on the course as they play. A good rule of thumb is that music shouldn’t be played at a volume that would bother other players on the course, and you should always ask the rest of your group if they are OK with it. Unless you’re at Augusta National Golf Club or the like, having cell phones on the course is generally permitted. But please silence your ringer. And limit your phone calls on the course. But cell phones are often used with golf apps that help you navigate the course or keep score, so they are part of the game now. Comments are closed. Yes!

As a beginner golfer, are the endless amount of rules beginning to confuse you? If so, just know you aren’t alone. While golf is an amazing sport, one thing that makes it difficult for beginners is understanding the obnoxious amount of rules that come with it. In fact, even golfers who have been playing for decades still don’t know all the rules. And if they do, they certainly don’t always adhere to them. So if you’re just getting started in this wonderful game, don’t beat yourself up. The goal is to know the most important rules and as you become more advanced, keep learning along the way. In this post, I’ll share why the rules are so important and 15 of the most common situations that can happen on the golf course. If you’re a beginner golfer, it’s sort of accepted that you won’t know all the rules at first. And that’s more than okay, everyone has to start somewhere. But if you want to start playing nicer courses and start playing more competitively, it’s best to know the rules. Here’s why understanding the rules of golf matter: Needless to say, keep the game pure by sticking with the rules. Now, here are the most common rules that you need to know if you want to start taking your game to the next level. The United States Golf Association (USGA) has a big rule book but we’ll do our best to simplify everything below. While this isn’t an official rule, it’s good practice to identify your original ball on the first tee. Also, play ready golf to save time and speed up the pace of play. The USGA limit is 14 clubs per bag as you start the beginning of your round. If you have more than 14 clubs in your bag, you will receive a two-stroke penalty for every hole (or you might be disqualified) according to rule 4-4. This shouldn’t be an issue for most players as your equipment doesn’t change week in and week out like the pros. But make sure to double-check before you leave the driving range or hit your first tee shot as this is an easy penalty to avoid. If you’d like, you can play with less than 14 clubs but it’s not something that we recommend. Golf is hard enough with 14 clubs, don’t make it harder by not using all the weapons available. The next rule is to make sure that you always tee your ball behind the tee markers. If you’re in front of them at all (even an inch), you will receive one penalty stroke. But don’t feel like you’re confined to the area directly in between the tee markers either. The rules of golf allow you to go to two full clubs behind the markers with your longest club (i.e. driver). This should give you roughly 90 inches behind the tee markers. If you’re in between clubs for a certain tee shot, this is a good strategy as you can make the distance longer and a better fit for your longer club. Additionally, you can stand outside the tee box as long as the entire ball is teed up between the markers. This might help open up one side of the fairway and play your slice easier. Just don’t get so close to the markers that you accidentally hit them as you’ll likely damage the club. Like they said in Happy Gilmore, “You have to play it where it lies” …well, for the most part. In most cases, you need to play the ball from the lie you found it, but there are exceptions to the rule. You’re allotted a drop if your ball is on the cart path, near a man-made object or it’s a marked area like “ground under repair.” If you can’t identify the ball, you are allowed to rotate the ball to confirm it’s the one you hit. Once identified, you must rotate it back in the same position as you found it and not move it. Additionally, the USGA said, “Players should take care when near any ball at rest, and a player who causes his or her own ball or an opponent’s ball to move will normally get a penalty (except on the putting green).” Out of bounds, commonly referred to as “OB” is when your ball ends up outside the course of play and is generally identified with white stakes. Or, it might be a fence, wall, or other structure of the course (make sure to check local rules on the scorecard too). For the most part, this is usually on the outskirts of the course like a road, ditch or fence. Rarely, is out of bounds within the confines of the course but it can happen (this is known as “in course OB”). Hitting out of bounds is a two shot penalty and you have to replay the previous shot. When you hit a ball out of bounds, you must replay from where the previous shot was played. Instead of hitting two after your first shot goes out, you’re now hitting three from the tee box. If you hit it OB from anywhere other than the tee box, you must try to recreate the previous shot you hit and add two strokes. As you can imagine, hitting a ball OB can slow down play as penalty strokes add up. To avoid slowing down the pace of play, you can hit a provisional ball. If you’ve hit a shot that you think might be OB, don’t wait until you get up there to figure out. A provisional is a backup in case your original ball goes out of play. This will help you not have to walk or ride back if the ball is indeed lost. To hit a provisional, make sure you clearly announce to fellow players that you are hitting a provisional and identify the new golf ball. Otherwise, it will count as your shot even if you find the original golf ball. If things go bad on that shot, you can hit another provisional as well. The biggest thing is to make sure to identify your shot as a provisional, so there’s no confusion when searching for balls. Also, don’t hit a provisional ball if you think you went into a water hazard, only if you think it’s out of bounds. Make sure to read our full article on hitting a provisional ball in golf. Hitting in the water is never fun but it’s part of golf, even to the best players. Whether it’s Jordan Speith making a 7 on hole 12 at August or Sergio making a 13 on hole 15 at Augusta, it happens! It’s important to know how to take your drop when your ball ends up in the water. You have several options: If your ball isn’t fully submerged, you always have the choice to play it from the water. There is no penalty but it is usually a risky shot that isn’t easy to pull off. Not to mention you might ruin a club or golf outfit. But if you want to play it from the water, have at it. If your ball ends up wet, identify the penalty area stake color as there are two main types; red and yellow. A red penalty area is a lateral hazard while a yellow stake is a water hazard. Here is how the USGA defines them, “When you take relief from a penalty area, you get one penalty stroke. For yellow penalty areas, you have two relief options. For red penalty areas, you have three relief options (the same two relief options as you do for yellow, plus one additional option.)” With red hazards, you can take relief in one of three ways: Penalty areas marked with yellow stakes only allow two drop options. You can drop in the relief area or the line of sight. You cannot drop laterally like a red penalty area. Most hazards are red but it’s important to double-check so you don’t get any extra penalty strokes. You can read more about the penalty area rule here. You might wonder, “What happens when your ball is lost?” A few things as a ball lost hurts the wallet and scorecard. You have to play it like the ball is out of bounds and replay the shot. If you think the ball is lost, you should hit a provisional ball to speed up play. When searching for your ball, always double check it’s yours to avoid hitting the wrong golf ball. There is nothing worse than hitting an opponent’s ball! Read our full article on the rules about lost golf balls. As a beginner, I’m sure you’re starting to find out that your golf ball can end up in some weird situations. If your ball ends up in an area that is unplayable but you can find it, you are allowed to take a drop known as an “unplayable lie.” You will receive a one stroke penalty for the drop and there are several ways to drop the ball. For example, let’s say you find your original ball in a bush or cactus. Unlike hitting out of bounds, you don’t have to go back to the previous stroke unless you want to. When you take an unplayable ball relief, here are the different drop options. Regardless of how you drop, try to think about where you will drop so you have a good lie on your next shot. When your ball ends up on a cart path or the cart path is interfering with your swing, you get free relief. Yes, you read that right, you get a free drop. Just make sure you tell your playing partners and then do the following. Once you find your ball on the path, start by finding the nearest point of relief. Once you do, put a tee in the ground for that spot. Then, take a club that you intend to use (or go with a driver for the longest club) and you get to drop within one club length of the spot. Make sure you don’t drop the ball closer to the hole! Don’t forget that you have to drop at the nearest point of relief, even if it is a bad lie or in a shrub. That being said, you can always opt to hit off the path if you think it’s a better lie. If it’s a concrete path it’s much easier than pavement as it can damage your clubs. Read our full article on Cart Path Relief for more details on this rule. Whiffing the golf ball as a beginner is part of golf. If you do miss the ball that you intended to hit, you receive a one-stroke penalty. But if your ball falls off the tee or you accidentally hit during a practice swing, there is no penalty. This seems to happen to Zach Johnson a lot (watch him shank a driver off the tee peg at the Masters here). Do you ever miss a putt and want to hit it again once you’ve finished the hole? Unfortunately, you can’t practice shots between holes unless you’re in a match play event. Otherwise, there is a one-shot penalty in official stroke play rounds. Surprisingly, this even includes using your wedge to hit range balls back into the range. Save the practice for before or after the round. As a beginner, it’s easy to want to ask other players what club they’re hitting or maybe some advice on a tough shot. If you’re playing with friends in a casual round, no worries. But if you’re trying to really take it seriously, keep score or play competitively, asking for advice is actually a one-shot penalty. Even if you ask a player which club they used on a certain, this is a one shot penalty too. You can’t ask for advice on club selection or anything else other than a partner (if it’s a team event) or caddie. If you do have rules questions, want to know the distance or where a hazard might be, you can ask fellow players. Bunkers challenge golfers and there are some things to be aware of to avoid an unnecessary penalty stroke. First, never ground your club! You need to hover your club above the sand, both fairway and greenside bunkers. Otherwise, you have to take a one shot penalty if your club touches the sand. This includes practice swings too. But one thing you can do is remove loose impediments without penalty (in stroke play or match play). If there is a rock, cigarette butt, trash, or something else you can remove it from the bunker. Once you are on the putting green, you are allowed to mark the golf ball with a circular object. Make sure you mark your ball directly behind it with a coin or marker and replace your own pitch mark. If asked to move your mark for another player, you are allowed to do so; just make sure that you replace it before you putt out. Additionally, you can repair spike marks and should always repair divots on the green. Don’t forget, you cannot mark a ball that isn’t on the green (including the fringe). The only exception to this rule is if you’re playing “Lift, clean, and place” which is common during wet, winter golf conditions. You must play the same ball on an entire hole, even if it gets damaged from the cart path or trees. Once the hole is complete, you can get rid of the original ball and replace it with a new ball. Additionally, if you mark your golf ball with a sharpie, the official rules don’t allow you to update/add markings duringthe hole either. You have to wait until the hole is complete to refresh your ball markings. Finally, if you’re a tournament double-check the “one ball rule.” If this rule is in effect, you need to play the same brand and type of ball during the entire round. For example, if you’re playing a Titleist ProV1, you can’t switch to a Titleist AVX later in the round. If you’re entering the competitive arena of golf, you will exchange scorecards with one of your playing partners at the beginning of the round. During the round, you will keep their score at the top of the scorecard and yours at the bottom. Even though someone else is keeping your score, it’s vital to keep yours as well. Because golfers are human and make mistakes. You want to double-check what the other person scored for you after the round. After the round is over, make sure to thoroughly check the scorecard, hole by hole. I can’t stress this enough, don’t glance and confirm it until you’re 100% sure. Once you both agree on the card, two signatures are needed to make it official. Don’t forget to sign the scorecard; not signing it will make it invalid and get you disqualified! If you screw up and give yourself a lower score than you made, your scorecard is not valid and you are disqualified. If your score is higher than you meant, your scorecard is valid but you must accept the higher score. I’ve seen a friend get DQ’d after a final round from signing an incorrect scorecard so always sign it before leaving the scoring table. Also, if you’ve used the scoring symbols to tally the score, go back and make sure you’ve actually added up the numbers. A circle could look like a square and vice versa. 2019 brought some big rule changes to the game of golf; here are three of the biggest changes in case you’ve been away from golf for some time. Perhaps the biggest rule change in 2019 was the ability to leave the flagstick in when you’re on the putting green. Previously, if you made a putt with the flag in, you would receive a penalty shot. But now, the flag can always stay in, even from the putting surface! If you hit a ball in a bad spot, you now only have three minutes instead of five to search for it. Also, it’s common courtesy to help other players look for a ball so make sure to do so as they’re more likely to help you as well. Prior to 2019, you were never able to ground your clubs in hazards. Like the bunker, you had to hover the club withouttouching the ground. Now, if you find yourself in a lateral hazard (now known as a penalty area) you can ground your club! Another huge change to the rules of golf is how to drop your golf ball. Whether you hit one in the water, take an unplayable or need relief from sprinkler heads, you previously had to drop the ball from shoulder height. Now, when taking relief you must take a drop from your knees. In fact, if you drop from your shoulders, you’re actually given a penalty shot! This is pretty crazy but it makes dropping easier as you should get a better lie dropping from a smaller distance. Hopefully, this guide will help you avoid any rule debacle and not waste any shots for rule infractions. Remember, if you ever have a question about the rules, ask your fellow playing partners. However, if no one in your group knows the answer, you always have the option to invoke Rule 3-3. This rule allows you to play two golf balls into the hole. Once a competitive round is complete, you can ask a rules official or club pro which score to use. In the early stages of your golf journey, focus on some basic rules like: Read our full guide on the 15 Unwritten Rules of Golf if you are a beginner. Also, make sure to confirm if it’s match play or stroke play and the rules change. If you still want some more help, make sure to buy other equipment like the rules of golf pocket guide for your bag.

Looking to climb the corporate ladder? Want to hob-nob with the elite? Or perhaps you're just looking for an active new hobby? Golf and business relations go hand in hand. But it's also a great past time. If you want to learn more about this all-ages sport, here are the basic golf rules you need to know. The ultimate goal in golf is to get your golf ball into the hole. A typical golf course has 18 holes, each with its own playing area. The fewer strokes it takes to get your ball into the hole, the better your score is. Each hole is located several hundred yards away from the starting point, or "teeing ground." There are several different ways to play the game. In the most common format, each person in your group will take their first stroke. After everyone has taken the first stroke, you each locate your ball and take your next stroke This continues until everyone is finished. A large part of understanding golf is understanding the scoring. Your score is the number of strokes it takes you to hit the ball into each hole. That means that the person with the lowest score wins. In some cases, scoring is stated in terms of "par." The par for each hole is the number of strokes a good player would need on that hole. Each golf course has its own par. Most are somewhere around 72 par for the full course. This tends to include a mixture of par three, par four, and par five holes. As with most sports, the rules of golf can be complex. However, here are the basics you need to know: As you're playing a hole, the rule is that you need to "play the ball as it lies." That means you can't move the ball to create an easier shot for yourself. There are a few exceptions. On standard parts of the course, you can remove leaves that cover your ball. You can also remove artificial impediments like litter and rakes. If your ball lands in a "hazard" like a pond or a sand trap, the rules are different. You can only move enough material to let you see part of the ball. The rules are also different on the green: the darker green area surrounding the hole. If your ball is on the green, you can't move it but you can remove anything that blocks its path. At the first hole, your group can tee off in any order you choose. When you make your next strokes, though, the person whose ball is farthest from the hole will play first. When you finish one hole and move onto the next, the person with the best score on the previous hole will play first on the next hole. You may have heard golfers ask each other, "What's your handicap?" Your handicap is a score that reflects your typical performance: how far above par you tend to be. Calculating your handicap can be tricky because a handicap with high accuracy accounts for each course's difficulty. The best way to get an accurate handicap is to play at least ten times on the same course and turn in your scores to the clubhouse. After you know your handicap, you can use this to even the playing field when playing against more experienced golfers. Now that you know the basic golf rules, hit the links and start playing! There are certain aspects of golf that you'll only learn by playing with experienced golfers who can explain situations as they arise.

Fancy a weekend watching golf's legends play through but have no idea what's going on? We can help The 2016 edition of the Ryder's Cup is from September 27 to October 2 and to many of us, golf championships mean nothing or less. Mostly because we don't know what is going on apart from the 'hitting a ball with a club and it goes into a hole' part. Guides came up with a dummy guide for beginners to understand golf and hopefully, all of us will come to love this gentleman's game. A golf course has nine or 18 holes. For major tournaments, 18-hole courses are used. They have a grass surface, and each of the 18 holes comes with its own challenge. Clubs Most notably, a golfer has their own set of clubs. To the average philistine they may just look like a lot of sticks in a bag, but each club is different and offers the golfer a different option. There are three main types: woods, irons, and putters. Note: You must never ever refer to the club as a stick or a bat in close proximity to a golfer or someone who enjoys the game as the said stick or bat may be used to injure you grievously. A player is allowed up to 14 clubs in their bag Woods are generally used to wallop the ball miles, such as when teeing-off (which is golfist for “start”), irons are used to get out of tricky spots or to chip onto the putting green, and putters are only used on the putting green to gently knock the ball into the hole. A golfer is allowed a maximum of 14 clubs in total. There are other types, such as hybrids. Balls Balls are mainly white, but are sometimes coloured. They are covered in pock marks so they fly through the air faster. Tee You will notice that at the start of every hole, a golfer uses a tee. A tee is a small pin that goes into the ground to keep the ball still and at a certain height. It can’t be used anywhere else but each hole’s respective teeing ground (the start point). Glove No, not gloves, a single glove. Golfers wear one glove to prevent blisters and maximise grip on the lance of the club. The last thing they want is for it to slip through their hands. Trousers The trousers might be funny to look at, but they are light and baggy to allow the golfer full swing. Note: Try not to snigger A glove, a tee, a ball, and an iron Summary The idea of golf is to get the ball in each of the 18 holes in the fewest strokes possible. The golfer tees off for each hole with the aim of getting the ball as close as possible to the putting green – or as close to the hole as possible. Par You will hear the term 'par' a lot, and whether a golfer is 'under' or 'over' it. Under par is good, whereas over par is not quite as good. The common par for a hole is three which means the golfer must try to get the ball in the hole from the teeing ground in three strokes. This par could be two, four and rarely, five. If he or she does it two strokes for a 'par' of three, they are -1 (1 under par). If they do it in four strokes, they are +1 (1 over par). If they do it on three, their score is 0, they are therefore on par. Note: The lower the score the better. Scoring terms Naturally there are names for each of the different scores Penalties As you would expect, there are penalties in golf that, unless you’ve been paying attention, can be quite confusing. Golf is some 600 years old, and in that time etiquette on the golf course has been considered one of the sport’s most important aspects. Each course or visiting tour competition will have their own specific rules, and these will be clearly publicised, so pay attention. However, here are some general dos and don’ts. If you’re following a player around the course, remain totally silent when they are taking a shot – be it teeing off, a shot on the fairway, or on the putting green. Turn your phone off or keep it on silent – if a PGA golfer is keyed up to win the European Tour on the last hole and he is interrupted by the hateful Samsung whistle then you are going to be the most-hated person on the planet. Don’t even attempt to take pictures or videos of the players while they’re out on the course. If there’s one thing Guides learnt at the HSBC Championship, it’s that the course officials will shout at you if you try to video the action. There is usually a designated area where photos are allowed, so learn where when you arrive. If you’re watching by the side of the teeing-ground, stand still. Fidgeting and fumbling will cause an unwanted distraction. Remarkably, there are some spectators who want to offer golf advice to professional golfers. At the HSBC Championship, Guides was following Bryson DeChambeau who, despite technically being an amateur, was actually leading the entire tournament after day one. Yet still, one fellow spectator kept offering advice and minute-by-minute updates on the weather. His guidance was not well received. Generally the fairway is roped off to spectators, but sometimes a ball can stray into the rough (which is golfist for “that bit that isn’t part of the course”). Never, ever touch or pick up someone’s ball, even if no one is around. You don’t know if it’s still in play and if the player is coming to get it. Leave it alone. Rather than follow a golfer around, some people opt to set up a picnic at a specific hole for the day. If this is the case, then do not get in their way. If you’re standing in a group then ensure the tallest people remain at the back. Never swear while on the golf course. After a player has made a shot, it is acceptable to lightly clap and, if it was a belter, offer congratulations. Try to refrain from excessive whooping. Leave your emotions at the gate. If you don’t like a particular player, then keep it to yourself. Any heckling or abusive behaviour will see you ejected and barred. Never cross the fairway during play. There is a path that runs around the course that you should follow. However sometimes the path does cut through the fairway. For big tournaments it will be fenced off and opened by the officials between play. If it is not fenced off, look up the fairway to the teeing ground to see if the hole is being played. If it is, wait. Pro golfer Paige Spirinac swings for the hole with the wood from the fairway Cup The actual name of the hole Marker The flag stick, which helps identify the hole’s location from afar. It’s removed when the players arrive at the putting green Rough The immediate ground surrounding the course or fairway. It is commonly an area with longer grass or isn’t as smooth. It acts as the border of the course Out of bounds The area that is not part of the course Sand Bunker Often used as an alternative to “sand trap” Water hazard A body of water which will annoy players if their ball lands in it Fairway The specific part of the course between the teeing ground and the putting green. This can be in either one or multiple sections Putting green The super-smooth surface immediately surrounding the hole. Usually just referred to as the “green” Wedge Type of golf club, similar to the iron but with a sharp angled face Drive Usually the first hit of the ball with a driver club. The idea is to wallop the ball Chip A short stroke used to chip the ball out of the rough or onto the putting green Putt The light tapping of the ball in an effort to get it into the hole Fore Players may shout “Fore!” when they drive the ball as a warning to other players who may further along the course Caddy The player's assistant who carries the bag full of clubs Sign up for the Daily Briefing Get the latest news and updates straight to your inbox Related Stories Tiger Woods recovery 'not as fast as I'd like' UAE's Skaik makes professional debut in Portugal Saudi Arabia emerges as golf’s hottest new hub Tommy Fleetwood set for 2026 Hero Dubai Desert Classic

Hey so i’m looking to regrip my clubs and was just looking to hear some feedback on the feel and durability of different models. I played the tour wrap midsize last year, which i thought was solid but on the really humid days i felt my hands slipping no matter what even if i rubbed it with a towel right before (tried cleaning them too and it didn’t improve much). that being said im looking at the MCC and tour velvet models now. I was planning on using the MCC grips because of the humidity, and on top of that I already get sweaty palms. but i bought new irons that came with MCC grips in standard size (club customization was unavailable at purchase so the irons came with stock shafts and grips) and don’t love the grips. i know the are a firmer feel but coming off the tour wrap it’s quite the change. That brings me to my final question. should i try the tour velvet or try mcc midsize grip? of course i can go into my local store and try them both im just looking for some user feedback.

If you’re someone who’s been playing golf a while, you know there isn’t much worse than having to deal with poor golf etiquette. It’s one thing to play with someone who’s a brand new golfer but it’s entirely different to play with someone who should know better. In my opinion, someone’s golf etiquette can really make or break a round, especially if you’re playing with complete strangers. Because let’s face it, you only get one first impression. And the quickest way to never get invited back to a new club is having poor etiquette. People can forgive bad golf as it happens to everyone but bad etiquette leaves a bad taste with other golfers. Luckily, once you’re finished reading this post you can avoid a lot of common etiquette mistakes. If you follow these golf etiquette rules, I’m confident you will make friends, grow your network, and always get invited back. This is one of the easiest things to do yet so many people still make this mistake every single day. Please make sure to show up at least 20 minutes before your tee time. It’s rude to fellow players and bad for your game when you scramble from the car to the 1st tee box. You want to arrive at least 20 minutes early so you can check in, stretch, get loose, and hit some range balls. And even if you “Don’t want to waste all of your shots” on the range”, you should at least hit some putts and chips. There isn’t much worse than stepping up to the first tee cold and the first green trying to guess the speed. Showing up early will make it a better experience and most likely a better round for everyone. And you’re more likely to avoid injury too. Aim to arrive at least 20-30 minutes before your scheduled tee time. If you’re new to the game, you probably think golf carts are the best thing ever. And while they are awesome, make sure you check with the golf shop before driving all over the course. Depending on the season and conditions, you might only get to drive on the cart path. This usually happens with winter golf or when it’s really wet conditions to make sure the carts don’t tear up the course. You will also find this is pretty common on holes 1, 9, 18 or any other holes that can be seen from the parking lot or outside the course. They do this to show off course conditions to people driving by or first seeing it. Keep that first impression of the course positive by obeying cart path only signs. Make sure to check with the starter and don’t try to drive likes it’s a Fast and the Furious movie. And stick with the 90* rule whenever possible. Another quick way to look like you’re brand new on the course? Warming up on the putting green with a bucket of range balls. Please use your own golf balls and don’t use more than three golf balls on the putting green. Also, make sure they are clearly marked to avoid confusion and don’t putt in the way of other people. The other tips mentioned are important but I’d argue this is the biggest golf etiquette screw up on the list. When someone is hitting, stay silent! When you’re standing over the golf ball, you can hear a twig break and one whisper can screw your swing up. This is the biggest faux paus on the golf course and can really make other golfers angry. Make sure to stay off your phone and always know when people are hitting. This will help you play ready golf and not interrupt another players swing. Speaking of talking on the course, another piece of golf etiquette for dummies is to only talk to your golf ball. There is nothing worse than someone saying talking to your golf shot. I hate hearing other golfers say things like “Stay out of the water” or even worse “Great putt” about your shot before it actually went in. Talk to your ball and your ball only. Aside from talking in someone’s swing, I’d argue this is the next most important piece of golf etiquette. It is extremely distracting to have someone stand behind your line of sight when putting. And if that person moves, it’s even more annoying and awkward. If you need a read from them, stand aside and run up afterward to look at the break. On the putting green, you want to make sure to watch your shadow and never stand directly behind anyone. You also don’t want to stand behind the hole as it’s also distracting as well. Make sure to stand behind fellow players if possible or far enough away to not be in the line of sight. Speaking of putting etiquette, make sure you are super careful of where you walk on the green as well. While the rules of golf now allow you to fix spike marks, it’s still extremely rude to walk in a fellow players line as it can guide their putt offline. Not only do you want to avoid their original line but also their “through line.” The through line is where their ball would go if it missed long and avoid that line as well. Another great new rule of golf in 2019 is the shortened time to find a lost golf ball. Instead of five minutes you now have three minutes to hunt for wayward golf balls. Personally, I think slow golf is ruining public golf but the new rules in 2019 should help. If you think your ball is going into a hazard or potential trouble, please make sure to watch it land so you can find it quickly. Once your three minutes are up, take the drop and move on. Remember, it’s only a golf ball. And if you want to be a standout player, make sure to watch (not talk) to other players balls to help them find them quickly. A little good karma will never hurt on the golf course. As I mentioned, slow pace of play is turning away so many people from the game. At all costs make sure to play fast. My family motto growing up, Even if you’re playing bad, make sure that you play bad fast. If you notice that you’re behind the next group or get warned from a marshall, pick up, move faster, and stay with the group ahead. Please don’t let your ego get in the way either. No one wants a six-hour round. Speed up your round by using a GPS device or rangefinder instead of walking off sprinkler heads. Plus, if you’re just beginning golf, having the exact yardage probably is not going to matter that much anyway. And if slow play becomes a regular thing, tee it forward as it’ll make the game more enjoyable for you and everyone on the course. If you’re guilty of this one, make sure you study our article on how to let groups play through. One of the reasons golf takes so long is that most golfers aren’t playing ready golf. Ready golf is nothing more than being ready when it’s your time to hit. It’s about being prepared and not taking loads of time once you’re up. Whenever I’m playing with strangers I always say ready golf on the 1st hole to make sure the group plays ready golf vs. honor’s golf. The only time I’d recommend playing honors golf is when someone makes a birdie, eagle or you are in a competitive event. Otherwise, stick to ready golf. Not only will you play faster but I’ll bet you also stay in rhythm and shoot lower scores. This is a new golf etiquette rule but an important one. While phones and social media are addicting, don’t let them ruin a fun round with your friends. Get away from technology as much as possible and stay off your phone. If you need to keep it on or close by, please make sure it’s in silent mode and stay present throughout the round. Just because you putt out doesn’t mean it is time to go back to your phone and look at Facebook. Plus, staying off your phone will help with slow play and make it more fun for everyone in the group. Each group is different so make sure the rules are clearly established on the first tee, especially if money is involved. What happens if you spray one OB? Are you doing match or stroke play? Are you giving putts or putting everything out? It’s so important to establish the rules for the day before teeing off. There’s nothing worse than someone dragging a four-footer when no one gave it to them. Know the rules in advance and save yourself a lot of frustration later in the round. Check out our article on the rules of golf, to make sure you have basic understanding before showing up to the course. Also, make sure you understand what type of golf game you are playing. This rule is simple. Always know where other golfers are on the course. If your ball is heading toward another group, make sure to yell “FORE” loudly. And I like to add “FORE left” or “FORE right” if you’re in a congested area. Nearly getting hit can make other golfers extremely angry. So make sure you’re avoiding a fist fight on the course by yelling FORE if your ball is anywhere close. Congratulations if you hit the green in regulation. That probably means your ball created a small mark on the green. Some people call this a pitch mark. If you don’t want bad karma, you better repair your ball mark. Basically, you want to use a special golf tool to smooth out the mark left behind so that golfers behind you have a smooth roll if their putting line happens to cross where you mark happens to be. Read our full article on repairing ball marks. Golf is a little unique in the fact that you can’t just show up to the course wearing anything you want. Some courses are not that strict, but you need to be prepared to adhere to a certain dress code. For men, that usually means a collared shirt (tucked in), no jeans, and a few other requirements. Women get a little more flexibility but there are still some minimum standards you need to be aware of. If you’re new to golf, make sure you understand what to wear. Read our full article on the golfers dress code here. Or you are a woman, here is what women wear golfing. If you’re brand new to the game and you happen to make some of these mistakes, don’t worry. Learn from them and move on. But the biggest ones to avoid are talking in someone’s swing, walking in their line, and not yelling fore towards another group. The other 10 tips will not help your etiquette but also make it look like you know what you’re doing out there. Hopefully, you can use these golf etiquette tips to have more fun, make new friends, and play better golf this year. We’ve got more on this topic in our full guide to the 15 Unwritten Rules of Golf.

Playing golf is a fun, relaxing hobby for many people, and a competitive sport for some others. When learning to play golf, you’ll want to start by learning some basic rules and techniques for swinging a club to hit the ball. It’s also helpful to know how to obtain equipment and to learn some proper golf course etiquette so you can safely have fun with anyone you play with. Be proactive about learning from your mistakes. "You’re going to make mistakes. The key is to learn from them as fast as possible and make changes as soon as you can." Golf is a fun hobby and competitive sport where players try to hit their golf ball into different holes along a golf course in as few shots as possible. A standard golf course has 18 holes, although there are shorter 9-hole courses for beginners. Players start the game at the first hole on the course and move through all of the holes in order. At the beginning of each hole is a “tee off” area where players take their first shot for that hole. The smooth, short grass around the hole is called the “putting green,” and the grass between the tee off area and the putting green is called the “fairway.” On a player’s turn, they place their ball on a tee in the ground at the tee off area, choose a club to swing with, and use the club to hit the ball toward the hole. Once everyone in the group has taken their first shot, each player locates their golf ball and takes another turn, starting with the player who is furthest away from the hole. This continues until every player has made their golf ball in the hole, at which point the group moves onto the next hole and repeats the process. Players write down their score after each hole, with each stroke, or swing, they took for that hole counting as 1 point. For example, if it took a player 4 strokes to get their golf ball into the hole, they would score 4 points for that hole. Each hole on a golf course has an ideal number of strokes it should take to get the ball into the hole, called the “par.” A par 3 hole should ideally take 3 strokes to finish, for example. Finishing a hole 2 strokes under par is called an “eagle,” finishing one stroke under par is called a “birdie,” and finishing even with par is just called “par.” Finishing one stroke over par is called a “Bogey,” finishing two strokes over par is called a “Double Bogey,” and so on. The player with the lowest score after finishing all of the holes on the course wins the game. Players are allowed to carry multiple golf clubs with them on the course, and they choose which club they want to use depending on the shot they’re taking. Each type of golf club affects the height and distance the ball travels differently. The main types of golf clubs include woods, which are used to hit the ball long distances with minimal loft and are commonly used to hit the ball off of the tee or when it’s on the fairway; irons, which are used when the ball is less than 200 yards from the putting green and are numbered 1 through 9, with 9 having the most loft and 1 having the least; wedges, which have a high degree of loft and are used to hit the ball a short distance onto the putting green; and putters, which are used to roll the ball on the putting green toward the hole. To swing with a golf club, stand facing the ball with your feet hip-width apart, your knees slightly bent, and the head of the club next to your golf ball. Swing the club back and up behind you so it’s almost 180 degrees, then swing back down and make contact with the ball. Follow through on your swing by fully extending both of your arms. If you want to practice your swing before heading out on the golf course, visit a driving range, where you can practice hitting golf balls with different clubs until you get the hang of it.

Golf is extremely fun and also a little complicated. For beginners, getting into golf can seem daunting. From endless terminology to etiquette, different golf clubs, and more, there’s a lot to learn. But if we can do it, so can you! We’ve compiled a list of 100 frequently asked golf questions that beginners typically ask and answered them so you can get a head start on learning this great game. Without further ado, here are one hundred of the most common questions beginners ask about golf. These questions and answers should help prepare you for your first tee time, make you an informed buyer of golf clubs and accessories, and almost certainly guarantee your victory at golf trivia. New to the game? Here are some of the most common questions beginners ask about golf. To get started as a beginner golfer, you’ll need golf clubs, balls, and tees, as well as a bag to store the equipment in. You’ll also need golf shoes that won’t damage the course, appropriate golf clothing depending on the weather, a towel for cleaning your clubs, and a divot repair tool. Remember, as a beginner, you don't need to buy the most expensive or advanced equipment. Start with the essentials and gradually add to your collection as you progress in the game. Golfers are allowed to carry a maximum of 14 clubs in their bag per the United States Golf Association (USGA). The 14-club limit includes all types of clubs, such as drivers, woods, irons, wedges, and putters. It is up to the golfer to decide which clubs they want to include in their bag, considering their playing style, course conditions, and personal preferences. It's worth noting that while the maximum allowed is 14 clubs, golfers are not required to carry a full set. Beginners, for example, may start with a smaller set of clubs and gradually add more as they progress in the game. To play a round of golf, you typically need a set of golf clubs that covers various distances and shot types. At the very least, most golfers include the following in their bag: a driver, a 3-wood, a 5-wood, a 5-iron, a 7-iron, a 9-iron, a pitching wedge, a sand wedge, and a putter. This setup should allow you to play a full round of golf. Learn more: What Wedges Should A Beginner Golfer Carry? While there isn't a strict dress code at all golf courses, it's generally recommended to wear collared shirts, slacks or shorts, and golf-specific shoes or athletic shoes. Breathable, moisture-wicking clothing is recommended to help keep you cool and comfortable while out on the course. A hat is also wise to wear to help keep UV rays off your skin. Learn more: What to Wear Golfing: The Casual Guide to Golf Attire Start by positioning your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider and parallel to the target line. Distribute your weight evenly between both feet. A balanced stance allows for a stable foundation during the swing. Bend forward from the hips, maintaining a slight flex in the knees. Tilt your spine slightly away from the target, creating a slight angle with your upper body. Allow your arms to hang naturally from your shoulders. They should feel relaxed and comfortable, with a slight bend in the elbows. Place your hands on the club with a proper grip, one that feels most comfortable and natural to you as you swing. Start with your non-dominant hand. Hold the club just above the grip with the clubface square to the ball. Position the grip diagonally across the fingers of your non-dominant hand. The club should run from the base of your little finger to just below the heel pad of your palm. Wrap your fingers around the grip, applying light pressure. Align the "V" formed by your thumb and index finger towards your dominant shoulder. This position promotes control and helps prevent the club from twisting during the swing. With the non-dominant hand in place, place your dominant hand on the club just below the non-dominant one. You can either interlock the little finger of your dominant hand with the index and middle finger of the non-dominant hand or overlap the index finger with your little finger. The fingers of your dominant hand should wrap snugly around the club with the pad of your thumb resting on top of the grip. Aiming a golf ball involves aligning yourself and the clubface in relation to your intended target. The proper stance and grip are instrumental in correctly aiming the golf ball. Practice aligning yourself and the clubface during your practice sessions to develop a reliable sense of aim. The objective is to complete each hole in as few strokes as possible. The player with the lowest score at the end of the round wins the game. Though the game itself is slightly more complicated, that’s the general idea.

But golf doesn’t have to be expensive. There are countless ways to play golf on the cheap, from buying used clubs to playing later in the afternoon. Learn more: Golf Club Memberships Explained: Is It Worth It? The basic guidelines of golf etiquette are to show consideration for others, repair divots and ball marks, keep up the pace of play, and adhere to any course-specific rules. Golf is referred to as a gentleman’s sport. As such, it’s incredibly important for beginner golfers to familiarize themselves with the finer points of golf etiquette. There are a plethora of terms and phrases used in golf. Some of the most common terms a golfer will hear are: rough, green, hazard, bunker, par, birdie, eagle, scratch, drive, approach, chip, pitch, backswing, downswing, and more. For a near-complete list of golf terms, check out our Glossary of Golf Terms for Beginners. There are plenty of golfing apps available for beginners and professionals alike. GolfNow, GolfLogix, and Fairgame are just a few of the best golfing apps currently available. These apps help with everything from shot tracking to providing 3D previews of holes, club suggestions, training courses, and more. Though some experts say it takes a beginner anywhere from six months to a year to become proficient enough to play a round, we disagree. We recommend that you get out on the course and play, even if you find yourself scoring bogeys or worse on most holes. The value lies in the experience itself, and you're likely to learn something valuable along the way, regardless of your performance. Plus, golfing is fun! You don’t need to be a bodybuilder or Olympic-level athlete to play golf, though a basic level of fitness will certainly serve you as you play. Since a full 18-hole course involves a lot of walking, you should be fit enough to walk at least a few miles for several hours while carrying up to 30 pounds (the average weight of a full golf bag). Cardiovascular exercises, core-strengthening exercises, and strength training can all benefit golfers. If you want to increase your fitness level and improve your golf game at the same time, incorporate the following exercises into your workout routine: Whether you’re allowed to jam out to your favorite tunes while playing golf depends on the specific rules of the golf course you're playing at. Some golf courses allow players to listen to music using headphones or portable speakers, while others may have restrictions or prohibit it altogether. Even if music is allowed, it's important to be considerate of other players and maintain proper golf course etiquette. Keep the volume at a reasonable level to avoid disturbing other golfers, and ensure that you're still aware of your surroundings, including golfers in your group and potential safety warnings from the course. Here are some of the most common questions about playing golf. On average, a round of 18 holes for a group of four golfers can take approximately 4-4.5 hours to complete. However, actual playing times might range from 3-6 hours. The time it takes to golf 18 holes can vary depending on several factors, including the number of players both in your party and on the entire course, course conditions, pace of play, and individual playing styles. The cost of a round (often referred to as the “green fee”) really depends on where you’re playing. If you’re playing a public course, you might be able to play a full round for $30-35 while a prestigious, private golf course might charge upwards of $600 per player, not to mention membership fees. You can absolutely go golfing by yourself! Many golfers enjoy playing solo rounds as it allows them to focus on their game, enjoy the course at their own pace, and have some peaceful time outdoors. That depends on your motivation. If you want to hang out with your buddies and engage in some friendly competition, go golfing with a group! If you just want to get some practice in or need some alone time, golfing by yourself is totally acceptable. Group sizes can vary depending on the specific golf course and their policies. Generally, golf courses accommodate groups ranging from individual players up to four players per group. “Short game" refers to shots played close to or around the green. It primarily focuses on shots where the golfer needs control and precision to navigate the course and get the ball into the hole. Your short game will typically involve chipping, pitching, and putting, as well as bunker shots and greenside bump-and-run shots. Chipping refers to short, low-trajectory shots played from close to the green. Pitching involves hitting the ball higher and with more loft than a chip shot. Golfers use a variety of clubs, such as wedges or even irons, to hit the ball a short distance and make it land softly on the green, allowing it to roll towards the hole. Pitch shots are used when the golfer needs to carry the ball over an obstacle, such as a bunker or a mound, and have it land softly on the green. An approach shot refers to the shot that a golfer plays from the fairway or rough with the intent of reaching the green. A slice is a golf shot that curves out and away from your dominant hand. For right-handed players, a sliced ball will travel far to the right, while a sliced ball will travel far to the left for left-handed players. Though there are intentional slice techniques, the fade shot being the most popular, most slice shots made by casual golfers are unintentional and detrimental to your game. A hook shot is the opposite of a slice in that the ball curves out and toward your non-dominant side. For right-handed golfers, a hook shot starts on the right side and curves sharply to the left. For left-handed golfers, a hook will start on the left side and curve sharply to the right. Hook shots typically land well clear of the intended target. A draw shot is an intentional hook-style shot that experienced golfers use to navigate around obstacles. Both fade and draw shots are intentional curving shots that golfers use to navigate around obstacles. They are similar to hook and slice shots, respectively, as they follow similar trajectories; however, these shots are intentional and controlled. A fade travels away from your dominant side, while a draw shot travels away from your dominant side. For many golfers, unintentional hooks and slices are caused by improper grip or swing. Adjusting your grip, changing to a more relaxed stance, and practicing your swing can all help reduce your hook and slice shots. Forgiving clubs with flexible shafts are also enormously helpful for casual golfers looking to stop hooking or slicing the ball. Learn more: What is a Golf Slice? 5 Steps to Improve Ball Flight If you can't find your ball within three minutes, it is considered lost, and you must play another ball from where you last played, incurring a penalty stroke. Out of bounds is any area on the golf course that is not considered fair play, typically indicated by white flags or poles. If your ball goes out of bounds, you must play another ball from where you last played, incurring a penalty stroke. Yes, you can stand out of bounds to make a shot as long as your ball is in bounds. As long as your ball is within the designated boundaries, you are allowed to take your stance and make your shot. Relief refers to a situation where a player is allowed to move their ball from its original position to a new location without penalty. Typically, players can take relief when their shot is hindered by an unintended obstruction (like a sprinkler head, cart path, etc.) or abnormal course conditions (temporary puddles, etc.). As long as it falls off without any action or influence from you, you can re-tee the ball. Different penalties apply if you accidentally knock the ball off the tee before taking your swing. A mulligan is the term used when a player is allowed to replay a shot without counting the stroke or incurring a penalty. It's essentially a "do-over" for a shot that did not go as intended. Mulligans aren’t actually recognized or permitted under the official rules of golf. Mulligans are more commonly associated with informal or friendly rounds of golf where players may choose to grant each other a mulligan as a courtesy or for recreational purposes. The order of play is typically determined by a method called "honors." On the first tee, the starting order may be based on an agreed-upon rotation or a random determination such as flipping a tee or drawing straws. After the first hole, the player with the lowest score on the previous hole typically earns the honors and tees off first on the next hole. In case of a tie, honors are retained by the player who had them on the previous hole. Though golfers have to place their ball within the tee box at the start of each hole, they don't have to put the ball on a tee. You can use a clump of dirt as a makeshift tee or even tee off straight from the grass. Learn more: Golf Tee Size: Which Tee Length is Best for You? Nope! You can only touch the ball without penalty when teeing up or taking the ball out of the hole. Touching the ball in other instances is permissible, but a penalty is incurred. A shotgun start in golf refers to a method of starting a tournament or event where groups of players begin their rounds simultaneously from different holes on the course. Instead of starting from the first hole in sequential order, each group starts from a different hole assigned to them. You know how to play, but do you know how to win? Using a scorecard, you’ll record the hole number you’re on as well as the number of strokes you took to complete the hole. You’ll also count any penalty strokes incurred on the hole, like hitting the ball out of bounds or into a water hazard. Once you’ve completed all holes, add up your strokes (including penalty strokes) to receive your final score. Match play and stroke play are two different scoring formats in golf. In match play, each hole is treated as a separate competition or "match" between players. The objective is to win the most individual holes throughout the round–the player that wins the most holes is the winner. Stroke play, also known as medal play, is the most common scoring format in golf. In stroke play, each player counts the total number of strokes taken over the entire round. The player with the lowest total score at the end of the round is the winner. A score of around 100 or below on a par-72 course is generally considered good progress for a beginner golfer. As you improve your skills and gain more experience, you can work towards breaking 90, 80, and eventually shooting par or better. Learn more about gold scoring terms → Gross score represents the total number of strokes a golfer takes to complete a round, including any penalty strokes incurred. It is the raw, unadjusted score without considering a player's handicap. Net score takes a golfer's handicap into account. The net score is calculated by subtracting the player's handicap strokes from the gross score. The purpose of the net score is to provide a more equitable way of comparing scores between players with different skill levels. A golf handicap or handicap index is a numerical score that measures a golfer's playing ability. A golf handicap represents the number of strokes a player is expected to take above or below the course's par score. The higher the handicap, the more strokes a player is allowed to subtract from their actual score to determine their net score. A lower handicap indicates a more skilled golfer who is expected to have a lower gross score. Learn more: Golf Handicap Explained (A Beginner’s Guide) Par represents the standard score for a hole. It is the number of strokes an accomplished golfer is expected to take to complete the hole. Par values can vary depending on the length and difficulty of the hole, with par 3 for shorter holes, par 4 for medium-length holes, and par 5 for longer holes. Under par refers to a score that is lower than the designated par for a particular hole or the entire round. Under par scores are commonly referred to as birdies, eagles, and double eagles or albatrosses. Being under par is generally considered favorable in golf, as it indicates that a golfer is scoring better than expected on a hole or over the entire round. The lower the score, the further "under par" the golfer is, which signifies greater skill and achievement. A birdie is achieved when a golfer completes a hole in one stroke under par. For example, scoring a 3 on a par 4 hole or a 4 on a par 5 hole would result in a birdie. An eagle is scored when a golfer completes a hole in two strokes under par. It signifies an exceptional achievement on the hole. For instance, scoring a 2 on a par 4 hole or a 3 on a par 5 hole would result in an eagle. An albatross or double eagle is an incredibly rare and extraordinary score achieved when a golfer completes a hole three strokes under par. This would occur, for example, by scoring a hole-in-one on a par 4 hole or by scoring a 2 on a par 5 hole. A bogey is scored when a golfer completes a hole in one stroke over par. It indicates a slightly less favorable outcome than par. For instance, scoring a 5 on a par 4 hole or a 6 on a par 5 hole would result in a bogey. Bogey scores are relatively common among golfers, especially on more challenging holes. They indicate that a golfer required one additional stroke to complete the hole compared to the expected par. While bogeys are not ideal, they are a part of the game and often provide opportunities for improvement on subsequent holes. A double bogey is achieved when a golfer completes a hole in two strokes over par. It indicates a score that is two strokes higher than the expected par for the hole. If a golfer takes three or more strokes over par on a hole, it is referred to as a triple bogey or simply as being "x" number of strokes over par, depending on the score. Everything a beginner needs to know about golf courses, from golf course layout to the best courses in the world. Beginner golfers can practice playing anywhere, from putting in your living room to hitting your local driving range. You can even practice at places like TopGolf for an unconventional twist. Learn more: Golf Lessons: Are They Worth It For Beginners? The fairway on a golf course is the closely mowed and manicured strip of grass that runs between the tee box and the putting green. It is the primary playing area of a hole and is typically wider and smoother than the rough areas that flank it. The rough refers to the areas of longer and thicker grass that flank the fairway on a golf course. It is intentionally left less maintained compared to the fairway and is designed to provide a more challenging playing condition for golfers. The green refers to the highly manicured, smooth, and closely mowed area at the end of each hole. It is the ultimate target and final destination of a golfer's shots. The green is where the hole, or cup, is located. A bunker, also known as a sand trap, is an area on the golf course filled with sand or fine gravel. Bunkers are strategically placed to add challenge and complexity to the game. Yes, repairing ball marks or divots is considered courteous to fellow golfers and to the course. Use a divot repair tool to fix any marks or divots on the green. A divot repair tool is a small tool specifically designed for repairing ball marks. Insert the prongs of the tool into the turf at the edges of the mark. Gently lift the turf with the tool, working around the edges of the mark. Once the edges are lifted, push the grass toward the center of the mark using the divot repair tool. Repeat on all sides until the mark is level with the surrounding turf. Gently smooth the repaired area with your putter or foot to ensure it is flush with the green. Avoid stomping or pressing down too hard, as this can cause more damage. A driving range is an area where golfers can practice their full swings with various clubs, primarily focusing on distance and accuracy. A practice green, also known as a putting green or chipping green, is an area specifically designed to help golfers improve their short game skills, including putting, chipping, and pitching. Learn more: 10 Tips to Improve Your Putting Skills Though the best golf course in the U.S. is largely subjective, experts tend to rank Augusta National, Pebble Beach, and Pinehurst (No. 2) among the top courses in the country. The Old Course at St. Andrews is largely considered to be the home of golf and the ultimate bucket-list golf course for golfers around the world. Augusta National, home of the Masters Tournament, is probably a close second in fame. The Old Course at St. Andrews Links in St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, is widely recognized as the oldest golf course in the world. The exact origins of the Old Course are unclear, but it has been played on since the early 15th century. Check out our ultimate golf course and tournament bucket list. Several factors contribute to golf course difficulty. Well-designed courses often incorporate strategic elements that demand thoughtful shot placement and strategic decision-making. Number of bunkers and water hazards can increase course difficulty, as can the size of the rough compared to the fairway, the slope of the course, elevation changes, and more. A full-sized golf course consists of 18 holes. Par 3 courses are shorter in length and feature predominantly par-3 holes. They are designed to be more beginner-friendly, providing a less intimidating and time-efficient golfing experience. Par 3 courses are ideal for practicing short game skills or golfers looking for a quick round. A links course is a traditional seaside course located along coastal areas. It features sandy dunes, natural grasses, firm conditions, and strategic bunkering. Links courses are known for their unique playing characteristics and are often associated with Scottish and Irish golf. A parkland course is typically located inland and is characterized by a more manicured and lush environment. These courses are often set within park-like settings with mature trees, well-maintained fairways, and defined rough. Desert courses are found in arid regions and take advantage of the natural desert landscape. They feature rugged terrain, native desert plants, and sparse vegetation. Desert courses often require strategic shot placement and careful consideration of hazards such as desert scrub, rocks, and arroyos. Mountain courses are built in hilly or mountainous regions, offering stunning views and challenging playing conditions. These courses feature elevation changes, sloping fairways, and undulating greens. Your questions about golf clubs answered. The sweet spot on a golf club refers to the area on the clubface where the ideal impact occurs between the ball and the club. When you hit a ball with the sweet spot of the club, it results in optimal energy transfer, generating maximum distance, accuracy, and a satisfying feel. In golf, bounce refers to a design feature of golf clubs, particularly wedges. It is the angle between the leading edge of the club's sole (the bottom part of the club head) and the lowest point on the sole. Bounce helps prevent the club from digging too deeply into the ground or sand when making a shot, especially on soft turf or in sand bunkers. Drivers are generally used for hitting long shots, like teeing off on a hole. You might also use a driver when hitting fairway shots on particularly long holes. Learn more: Driver vs. 3 Wood Off the Tee Irons are typically best for approach shots, par 3 holes, and even tee shots on tight or narrow holes. Irons are the perfect blend of distance and accuracy, making them a very versatile range of clubs. Learn more: Ultimate Golf Iron Buying Guide Sand wedges are one of the best clubs for any golfer, especially beginners and high-handicappers. As the name indicates, sand wedges are perfect for getting out of bunkers; they can also hit chip shots, half shots, and shots up to 90-100 yards. A pitching wedge is often used for approach shots to the green when you are within the range of 100 to 125 yards. Pitching wedges are also great for chip or bump-and-run shots. A gap wedge can achieve distances of 90-120 yards. Gap wedges are perfect for shots where you need distance, loft, and bounce. Many golfers reach for a gap wedge when they want the golf ball to get more airborne than a pitching wedge can achieve. Lob wedges are perfect for short, high shots that have very little bounce. Shots hit with a lob wedge travel 60-90 yards on average, which makes this wedge great for controlled shots you need to hit over a feature or stop quickly once they land. In our expert opinion, the pitching wedge and sand wedge are the best wedges for beginners to carry and the easiest wedges to learn. Learn more: What Wedges Should a Beginner Golfer Carry? Fairway woods are often used for tee shots on longer par 4 and par 5 holes where distance is important, but accuracy is also necessary. Additionally, if you find yourself in trouble, such as being in the rough or behind obstacles, fairway woods can be handy for recovery shots. In general, a driver will hit the ball the farthest, up to 300 yards depending on a golfer’s swing speed. The 3-wood comes in second, with golfers hitting shots up to 215 yards. Learn more: What is The Average Distance for Each Golf Club? The different golf club numbers correspond to the loft angles of the clubfaces, which influence the trajectory and distance of shots. Learn more: Ultimate Guide to Golf Wedge Degrees Shaft flex refers to how flexible the shaft of a particular golf club is. Most golf clubs can be customized to have a stiff, regular, or active flex. Shaft flex influences the power and accuracy of your swing. Learn more: Stiff vs. Regular Flex: Which Golf Shaft is Right for You? Golf club length, or shaft length, refers to the height of your golf club. The standard club length for most manufacturers is 45 inches for drivers and around 35 inches for irons, putters, and wedges; however, this length can be adjusted to your height so you can play comfortably and effectively. Learn more: Golf Club Length: Which Size is Right for You? Golf clubs are usually made out of a combination of different materials. Drivers and fairway woods, for example, typically use titanium or composite materials for the club head, while irons and wedges use steel for the club head. Golf club shafts can be made of either steel or graphite. With regular play, a brand new set of clubs can last anywhere from 3 to 10 years. Significant wear and tear is a clear sign to replace your clubs, as is a plateau in your progress. Learn more: How Long Do Golf Clubs Last? When Should You Replace Them? Game-improvement clubs are usually geared toward beginner or high-handicap players. These clubs include a high degree of forgiveness which helps with both accuracy and distance. Steel shafts are heavier and provide more stability and control. They are preferred by many experienced golfers who seek accuracy and a consistent ball flight, whereas graphite shafts are preferred by beginner golfers. Graphite shafts are lighter and more flexible, providing increased clubhead speed, distance, and a smoother feel. Deciding whether to buy new or used golf clubs depends on your budget as well as how often you plan on playing. If you plan on playing infrequently or have a low starting budget, buying a set of gently-used golf clubs is a great idea. The price of golf clubs can vary significantly from brand to brand. Golf club sets can cost upwards of $2000 and more for high-end sets or $250 for cheap sets. Single clubs have wide price ranges as well. A premium driver from a big golf brand might run you $600-800, whereas generic box stores might carry drivers for $50. Women’s clubs are typically shorter, more lightweight, and more flexible than men’s clubs. However, these specifications are based on generalizations and don’t factor in an individual’s abilities. Learn more: Men's vs. Women's Golf Clubs: Are They That Different? | The Best Golf Clubs for Women Every golfer needs a golf bag. How else are you going to carry all that gear?

This makes your bag easier to carry and helps you grab the clubs you need quickly while playing. Learn more: How to Organize Your Golf Bag for a Better Game Professionals end up carrying around 9-10 golf balls for an 18-hole course. However, beginners and high-handicappers (who tend to lose balls more frequently than the pros do) should carry around twelve or so for good measure. Ten tees should be plenty for a full 18 holes, though you could probably get away with carrying a full pack in your golf bag. You can’t play without a golf ball! Learn more about this key piece of the game. The dimples on a golf ball are carefully designed to maximize lift, reduce drag, optimize spin, and enhance stability. Dimples greatly impact the maximum distance, accuracy, and overall performance of a golf ball. The core of a golf ball is usually made of synthetic rubber or a mixture of rubber compounds, the mantle layer is typically made of materials such as synthetic rubber or thermoplastic materials, and the cover of a golf ball is typically made from surlyn or urethane. The right golf ball can influence your game. Soft golf balls are best for players with slower swing speeds (under 90 MPH) and provide better spin and loft than hard golf balls. Hard golf balls are best for players with fast swing speeds (100 MPH and greater) and provide more roll distance. Learn more: Soft vs. Hard Golf Balls: What Golf Ball Should You Use? A low spin golf ball is a two-piece ball with a hard cover compared to other balls. Low spin golf balls reduce backspin, resulting in a longer and straighter flight, which makes them great for golfers that hit high and slice or hook shots frequently. Miscellaneous golf questions for curious trivia lovers. Yes! Golf is a part of the Summer Olympics. The origins of golf are believed to trace back to Scotland. The game's early development took place in the 15th century, with evidence of golf-like activities being played in various forms throughout Scotland during that time. While the exact origins are not fully documented, it is widely accepted that Scotland played a significant role in the evolution of the sport, with St. Andrews often referred to as the home of golf.

Learning to play golf can be the most rewarding but frustrating goal you set yourself. There will be ups and downs, highs and lows, and at times you will ask yourself why you decided to embark on this journey. But remember every golfer has experienced what you are going through, picking a club up for the first time, swinging it through the air and hoping the club head makes contact with the ball. It will take time and effort but eventually it will all click into place and you will soon understand why golf is such an addictive sport. And if it doesn’t go quite to plan take some advice from golf legend, Gary Player. In this article we answer the top questions asked by beginner golfers to help you conquer your goal of making it around 9 or 18 holes. Booking a few lessons with a qualified PGA coach to nail the basic fundamentals of golf is a great place to start. This will avoid you picking up bad habits that become ingrained in set up and help you improve faster than figuring it out on your own. Although, golf lessons can be expensive and you will need to work out how much time and money you want to dedicate to your new hobby. Buying a block of 5 or 10 one to one lessons is the best way to progress quickly but if you want to learn golf on a budget there are some other options available. Most golf clubs or ranges offer group lessons such as ladies evening classes or seniors sessions for a small group of beginners to learn together. These are more affordable, but the downside to this type of lesson is the coach cannot pay as much attention to you individually. The internet is filled with golf instruction videos. However, be wary of listening to too many different instructors on YouTube – you don’t want to confuse yourself). You can also take online golf lessons via websites such as skillest.com to access world-class golf instructors at an affordable price. Shot Scope’s golf eBooks can also come in handy! Whatever route you take these first lessons will set you up for success! Under the rules of golf, you’re allowed a maximum of 14 clubs in your bag but realistically you will likely only use 6-8 clubs while you are learning. A half set that includes a driver, some mid irons, a pitching wedge and a putter is more than enough to get you started, and as a bonus it will be nice and light to carry. Have a look in your garage or ask a family member if they have an old set you can borrow for a few rounds before investing in your own set of clubs. A great alternative is to visit a charity shop or a 2nd hand club dealer such as www.2ndswing.com (USA) golfclubs4cash.co.uk (UK) or golfbidder.co.uk (UK) where you can pick up a set of clubs to suit your needs and budget. Set up and a smooth tempo is key to the perfect swing and hitting more consistent golf shots, if you don’t focus on your set up early on in your game you will be making life on the course tough for yourself. Even small details can have a big impact on where your ball ends up on the course. A slight misalignment in your set up can result in a detrimental slice or hook. To build a good set up takes time and effort. You will make mistakes and you need to correct these mistakes before it becomes second nature. Even the best golfers need to revisit their set up from time to time but there are some key fundamentals you should understand. Work with a golf coach to establish a good stance, understand ball position and develop a proper golf grip, a coach will also help you with alignment and aim points on the course. Stepping foot on the golf course for the first time can be an exciting but daunting experience as you move away from the comfort of the range where you have been learning. Once you have mastered a basic golf swing and set up, don’t delay progressing to the golf course. This will allow you to start putting your practice into play and learn other key fundamentals of the game such as short game, putting and course management. There is no correct answer for how many golf lessons you will need, but as a general rule around 5-10 lessons should be enough for you to gain the knowledge required to navigate around a golf course. On your first trip go with an experienced golfer who can keep you right about the rules and etiquette of the game, plus they should be able to give you some advice to make your first round more enjoyable. Unlike other sports, in golf the lowest rather than the highest score. However the scoring itself can sound like a foreign language to those unfamiliar with the terminology. The goal is to get your ball in the hole in as few strokes as possible. Every time you swing the club attempting to hit the ball you count this as a stroke. At the end of each hole tally up your strokes, and that’s your score for the hole. You may have to add additional penalty strokes if for example you lose a ball in water or trees. Once you’re finished your round, add up all strokes taken and this is your total score for the round. Ideally you want to get as close to par or under par as possible to achieve the lowest score and have the best chances of winning your match. Every hole on the course has a par rating that is the number of shots a golfer is expected to take to play that hole. Adding the pars up for each hole gives you the course par rating that you are expected to play the golf course as a whole. As a novice I am sure you have heard the terminology birdie or bogey! Here is a quick guide to explain scoring in golf… The scoring method mentioned above is called stroke play but there are many different formats used for keeping score when playing golf for example, match play, stableford and texas scramble. When starting out we recommended keeping it simple and following basic stroke play scoring. The best way to learn the rules of golf is to play with experienced golfers and do what they do. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or make mistakes, it’s how every golfer has learned to play. 1. The most important rule to know is Fore – As a beginner you are going to have a few stray shots, just remember to shout FORE if you see your ball traveling towards a group of people or hit it onto another hole on the course. 2. Be early for your tee time – You should arrive at the golf course at least 15-20 minutes before your tee time so you can check in, warm up and be ready on the first tee with no delay. 3. Avoid slow play at all times – There is no doubt as a newbie to golf you are going to take a little longer around the course than the pros! Don’t stress, take your time but if you are holding up golfers behind let them play through. 4. Repair your pitch marks on greens – A green full of ball marks can lead to missed putts! You should always find and repair your ball marks, it is super easy to do so and keeps the course in good condition for everyone to enjoy. 5. Keep quiet and respect other golfers – When a golfer is taking their shot, don’t distract them. If you are new to the game it can be hard to get the feel for distances on the course and how far each of your clubs are traveling. By investing in a basic GPS watch or a free GPS app it can help you understand how far it is to the green or a potential hazard on the golf course. Many modern golf ranges have Trackman or Toptracer devices allowing you to visually and accurately know the distance you can hit each club and the % miss left or right. After your session the app will give you access to your data allowing you to review and keep track of your improvements. Another great product to understand your club distances is a shot tracking device from companies such as Shot Scope. Similar to a GPS device it gives you distances to the front, middle and back of the green and distances to hazards such as bunkers and water. In addition, it tracks all your shots on the golf course. By tracking your shots Shot Scope will calculate how far you hit each club on average and allow you to view an overhead map of your round. This can be really beneficial for beginners to understand how far each club is traveling on the golf course to allow for correct club selection. Big numbers on your scorecard can be demoralising as a beginner but an easy way to limit the damage on your round is to identify your strengths and weaknesses. By using a shot tracking device to gather information on your game it will allow you to play to your strengths and avoid crucial errors. By knowing your data you can take more shots you’re good at and fewer of the shots you’re bad at. For example if you’re struggling off the tee, consider hitting three wood instead of your driver. Your scores will benefit by making smarter decisions. Let’s face it you are going to hit a few duff shots from time to time but even experienced players do the same. It’s important you don’t compound your errors. Never follow one bad decision by another. If you end up in a tricky situation, get the ball back into play as easily and quickly as possible rather than trying to pull off that glory shot. Shot Scope has a range of useful eBooks based on the data from its platform to help you understand where most amateur golfer’s lose shots on the golf course allowing you to avoid these mistakes and shoot lower scores. Download the free eBooks here > Golf is an emotional roller coaster and sometimes you will wonder why I put so much time and effort into practicing! When golf is hard and you had a bad practice session at the range or your round doesn’t go to plan, don’t give up! Every golfer experiences this from time to time, even the pros. It is important to keep calm and don’t get frustrated, that perfect round might just be around the corner.

A golf course is the grounds on which the sport of golf is played. It consists of a series of holes, each consisting of a tee box, a fairway, the rough and other hazards, and a green with a cylindrical hole in the ground, known as a "cup". The cup holds a flagstick, known as a "pin". A standard round of golf consists of 18 holes,[1] and as such most courses contain 18 distinct holes; however, there are many 9-hole courses and some that have holes with shared fairways or greens. There are also courses with a non-standard number of holes, such as 12 or 14.[2][3] The vast majority of golf courses have holes of varying length and difficulties that are assigned a standard score, known as par, that a proficient player should be able to achieve; this is usually three, four or five strokes. Par-3 courses consist of holes all of which have a par of three. Short courses have gained in popularity; these consist of mostly par 3 holes, but often have some short par 4 holes.[4] Many older courses are links, often coastal. The first golf courses were based on the topography of sand dunes and dune slacks with a ground cover of grasses, exposed to the wind and sea.[5] Courses are private, public, or municipally owned, and typically feature a pro shop. Many private courses are found at country clubs. The golf course has its roots dating to the 18th century. The 18-hole course Old Course was established in 1764 at St Andrews, Scotland, and has existed under its name since 1895. In 2009, Nullarbor Links, the world's longest golf course spanning 1,365 kilometres, was established along the Eyre Highway, in Australia. In 2023, the golf course at Moundbuilders Country Club, was integrated into the world heritage-listed Hopewell Culture National Historical Park. Although a specialty within landscape design or landscape architecture, golf course architecture is considered a separate field of study. Some golf course designers become celebrities in their own right, such as Alister MacKenzie; others are professional golfers of high standing and demonstrated appreciation for golf course composition, such as Jack Nicklaus. The field is partially represented by the American Society of Golf Course Architects, the European Institute of Golf Course Architects, and the Society of Australian Golf Course Architects, although many of the finest golf course architects in the world choose not to become members of any such group, as associations of architects are not government-sanctioned licensing bodies, but private groups. While golf courses often follow the original landscape, some modification is unavoidable. This is increasingly the case as new courses are more likely to be sited on less optimal land. Bunkers and sand traps are always built in by architects unless the formation of such items is already in the course's natural terrain.[6] The layout of a course follows certain traditional principles, such as the number of holes (nine and 18 being most common), their par values, and the number of holes of each par value per course. It is also preferable to arrange greens to be close to the tee box of the next playable hole, to minimize travel distance while playing a round, and to vary the mix of shorter and longer holes. Combined with the need to package all the fairways within what is frequently a compact square or rectangular plot of land, the fairways of a course tend to form an oppositional tiling pattern. In complex areas, two holes may share the same tee box, fairway, or even green. It is also common for separate tee-off points to be positioned for men, women, and amateurs, each one respectively lying closer to the green. Eighteen-hole courses are traditionally broken down into a "front 9" (holes 1–9) and a "back 9" (holes 10–18). On older courses (especially links courses, like the Old Course at St. Andrews), the holes may be laid out in one long loop, beginning and ending at the clubhouse, and thus the front 9 is referred to on the scorecard as "out" (heading out away from clubhouse) and the back 9 as "in" (heading back in toward the clubhouse). More recent courses (and especially inland courses) tend to be routed with the front 9 and the back 9 each constituting a separate loop beginning and ending at the clubhouse. This is partly for the convenience of the players and the club, as then it is easier to play just a 9-hole round, if preferred, or stop at the clubhouse for a snack between the front 9 and the back 9.[7] A successful design is as visually pleasing as it is playable. With golf being a form of outdoor recreation, the strong designer is an adept student of natural landscaping who understands the aesthetic cohesion of vegetation, water bodies, paths, grasses, stonework, and woodwork, among many other elements.[8] New environmentally responsible design practices mean that a successful design more than harmonizes with the landscaping; it benefits the environment. A successful design also not just pleasing and playable, but is environmentally responsible.[9] Most golf courses have only par-3, −4, and −5 holes, although some courses include par-6 holes. The Ananti CC and the Satsuki golf course in Sano, Japan, are the only courses with par-7 holes.[10] Par is primarily determined by the playing length of each hole from the teeing ground to the putting green. Holes are generally assigned par values between three and five, which includes a regulation number of strokes to reach the green based on the average distance a proficient golfer hits the ball, and two putts.[11] On occasion, factors other than distance are taken into account when setting the par for a hole; these include altitude, terrain and obstacles that result in a hole playing longer or shorter than its measured distance, e.g. route is significantly uphill or downhill, or requiring play of a stroke to finish short of a body of water before hitting over it.[12] Under the United States Golf Association, the typical distances for the various holes from standard tees are as follows:[12] Men Women The first section of every hole consists of the teeing ground, or tee-box. There is typically more than one available box where a player places his ball, each one a different distance from the hole (and possibly with a different angle of approach to the green or fairway) to provide differing difficulty. The teeing ground is generally as level as feasible, with closely mown grass very similar to that of a putting green, and most are slightly raised from the surrounding fairway. Each tee box has two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area. The teeing area spans the distance between the markers, and extends two-club lengths behind the markers. A golfer may stand outside the teeing area, but the ball must be placed and hit from inside it.[13] A golfer may place his ball directly on the surface of the teeing ground (called hitting it "off the deck"), or the ball may be supported by a manufactured tee (limited to a height of four inches), or by any natural substance, such as a mound of sand placed on the teeing surface. After the first shot from the tee ("teeing off"), the player whose ball is farthest from the green hits the ball from where it came to rest; this spot is known as its "lie". When the ball is in play and not out of bounds or in a hazard the player must play the ball as it lies.[14] The area between the tee box and the putting green where the grass is cut even and short is called the fairway. The area between the fairway and the out-of-bounds markers, and also between a mowed apron surrounding the green and out of bounds, is the rough; the grass there is cut higher and is often of a coarser strain than on the fairways, making roughs disadvantageous areas from which to hit. On par-3 holes, the player is expected to be able to drive the ball to the green on the first shot from the tee box. On holes longer than par 3, players are expected to require at least one additional shot to reach their greens. While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing ground to the green, a hole may bend either to the left or to the right. This is called a "dogleg", in reference to the similarity to a dog's ankle. The hole is called a "dogleg left" if the hole angles leftwards, and a "dogleg right" if the hole angles rightwards. A hole's direction may bend twice, which is called a "double dogleg". Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to "take a divot" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. Variants of grass used for fairways and roughs include bent grass, Tifway 419 Bermuda grass,[15] rye grass, Kentucky bluegrass, and Zoysiagrass. As in putting-green grass types, not every grass type works equally well in all climate types. The putting green, or simply the green, is an area of very closely trimmed grass on relatively even, smooth ground surrounding the hole, allowing players to make precision strokes on it. To "putt" is to play a stroke on this surface, usually with the eponymous "putter" club, which has very low loft so that the ball rolls smoothly along the ground, and hopefully into the cup. The shape and topology of the green can vary almost without limit, but for practical purposes the green is usually flatter than other areas of the course, though gentle slopes and undulations can add extra challenge to players who must account for these variations in their putting line. The green typically does not include any fully enclosed hazards such as sand or water; however, these hazards can be — and often are — placed adjacent to the green, and depending on the shape of the green and surrounding hazards, and the location of the hole (which often changes from day to day to promote even wear of the turf of the green), there may not be a direct putting line from a point on the green to the cup. Golfers use a method known as "reading" the green to enhance their chances of making a putt. Reading a green involves determining the speed, grain, incline, decline and tilt of the green on the line of the putt. Most putts are not struck directly at the hole, instead they must be struck to take into account the characteristics of the green to arrive at the hole at the proper angle and speed. The best players will read the green by walking around the green and studying the characteristics of the green before addressing the ball. Many golfers consider reading the green and putting to be the most difficult part of the game. The green is typically surrounded by slightly higher grass, cut at a height between that of the green and fairway, and then by the fairway and/or rough. This longer grass surrounding the green is known as the fringe and is designed to slow and stop balls rolling along the green from an approach shot or errant putt, preventing them from exiting the green. Though putting strokes can be made on it, the higher grass can interfere with the path of the ball, so players often choose to use a lofted club such as an iron to make a "chip shot" or a "bump and run", where the ball carries in the air for a few yards and then rolls along the green like a normal putt. The grass of the putting green (more commonly just "green") is cut very short so that a ball can roll for a long distance. The most common types of greens are for cold winter, but warmer summer regions (i.e., not extremely warm, as in the Southern and Southwestern United States) are bent grass greens. A green may consist of a thin carpet so that bad weather is not allowed to become a serious factor in maintaining the course. These are considered the best greens because they may be cut to an extremely low height, and because they may be grown from seed. Bent grass does not have grain, which makes it superior as a putting surface. However, bent grass may become infested with Poa annua, a costly and time-consuming weed. Augusta National is one of many golf courses to use this type of green. The original design of Augusta National did not include bent grass greens, but in the early 1980s the greens were converted from Bermuda to bent grass. This affected the speed of the greens, making them too quick, and several areas were subsequently remodelled to reduce the slopes and make them more playable.[16] Many other golf courses subsequently made the decision to change from Bermuda to bent grass when they observed increased business at courses that had already changed over.[17] Another type of grass common for greens is TifDwarf Hybrid Bermuda (other variants exist, but TifDwarf is one of the most common), or simply Bermuda grass. Bermuda is more common in regions that have very warm summers and mild winters, such as the Southern and Southwestern United States. Red Bridge Golf Course was the first course in North Carolina to utilize a special Bermuda called Mini Verde. A green is generally established from sod which has had the soil washed off of it (to avoid soil compatibility problems) and which is then laid tightly over the green, then rolled and topdressed with fine sand. Another common and more economical approach for establishing a putting green is to introduce hybrid Bermuda sprigs (the stolon of the grass which are raked out at the sod farm), which are laid out on the green. Two downside factors of Bermuda greens are cost of maintenance, and also the existence of grain (the growth direction of the blades of grass), which affects the ball's roll and which is called "the grain of the green" and not to be confused with "the rub of the green" which are idiosyncrasies encountered getting through the hole. The slope or break of the green also affects the roll of the ball. The hole, or cup, is always found within the green and must have a diameter of 108 millimeters (4.25 in) and a depth of at least 10 centimeters (3.94 in). Its position on the green is not fixed and typically is changed daily by a greenskeeper in order to prevent excessive localized wear and damage to the turf. A new hole will be cut by a device that removes a plug of the turf from the ground, and the reinforced cup is then moved, before the old hole is filled in with the plug cut from the new hole and levelled. The hole has a flag on a pole positioned in it so that it may be seen from a distance, but not necessarily from the tee. This location marker is officially called the "flagstick" but is also commonly referred to as the "pin". Flagsticks are made of either coated fiberglass, metal, or wood and have a metal or synthetic bottom (called a ferrule) that is designed to fit in the hole cup. Putting greens are not all of the same quality. The finest-quality greens are well-kept so that a ball will roll smoothly over the closely mowed grass. Excess water can be removed from a putting green using a machine called a water hog. Golfers describe a green as fast if a light stroke on the ball makes it roll a long distance; conversely, on a slow green a stronger stroke is necessary to roll the ball the same distance. The exact speed of a green can be determined with a stimp meter. By collecting sample measurements, golf courses can be compared in terms of average green speed. It is, however, illegal by the rules of golf to test the speed of a green while playing by rolling a ball on it, or by feeling or rubbing the green. The cost of installing and maintaining grass greens constitutes a considerable proportion of the expense of installing and maintaining a golf course. To save money, many low budget courses catering to casual players have sand greens instead of real grass. In recent years, artificial turf has also become an increasingly popular surface as a less costly alternative to grass which more closely resembles the appearance and feel of real grass compared to a sand surface. Design of a green with an elevated front is called a false front, as it deceptively causes the balls hitting this part of the green to roll off back.[18] Holes often include hazards, which are special areas that have additional rules for play, and are generally of two types: (1) water hazards, such as ponds, lakes, and rivers; and (2) bunkers, or sand traps. Special rules apply to playing a ball that falls in a hazard. For example, a player may not touch the ground or water with their club before playing the ball, not even for a practice swing. A ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty. If it cannot be played from the hazard, the ball may be hit from another location, generally with a penalty of one stroke. The Rules of Golf specify exactly the point from which the ball may be played outside a hazard. Bunkers are small to medium areas, usually lower than the fairway but of varying topography, that are filled with sand and generally incorporate a raised lip or barrier. It is more difficult to play the ball from sand than from grass, as the ball may embed itself into the sand, and the loose nature of the sand and more severe sloping of many bunkers make taking one's stance more difficult. As in any hazard, a ball in a bunker must be played without touching the sand with the club except during the stroke, and loose impediments (leaves, stones, twigs) must not be moved before making the stroke. Courses may also have other design features which the skilled player will avoid; there are earth bunkers (pits or depressions in the ground that are not filled with sand but require a lofted shot to escape), high grass and other dense vegetation, trees or shrubs, ravines and other rocky areas, steep inclines, etc.; while disadvantageous to play from, these are typically not considered "hazards" unless specifically designated so by the course (a ravine or creek bed may be termed a "water hazard" even if completely dry) Often, a golf course will include among its facilities a practice range or driving range, usually with practice greens, bunkers, and driving areas. Markers showing distances are usually included on a practice range for the golfer's information. Driving ranges are also commonly found as separate facilities, unattached to a golf course, where players may simply hit balls into the range for practice or enjoyment. There may even be a practice course (often shorter and easier to play than a full-scale course), where players may measure the distance they can obtain with a specific club, or in order to improve their swing technique. Practice courses often consist of old holes of a previous design that are kept and maintained for practice purposes or as substitute holes if one or more holes become unplayable; a 21-hole golf course, for instance, will have three additional holes that can be used for practice or as substitutes for a flooded or otherwise damaged hole. Many golf courses have what may be referred to as a "signature hole". This will commonly be the most memorable, aesthetically pleasing or photogenic hole.[19] Links is a Scottish term, from the Old English word hlinc : "rising ground, ridge", describing coastal sand dunes and sometimes similar areas inland.[20] It is on links land near the towns of central eastern Scotland that golf has been played since the 15th century.[21] The shallow topsoil and sandy subsoil made links land unsuitable for the cultivation of crops or for urban development and was of low economic value. The links were often treated as common land by the residents of the nearby towns and were used by them for recreation, animal grazing and other activities such as laundering clothes. The closely grazed turf and naturally good drainage of the links was ideal for golf, and areas of longer grass, heather, low growing bushes and exposed sand provided the hazards that are familiar on modern courses. Although early links courses were often close to the sea it was rarely used as a hazard, perhaps due to the instability of the dunes closest to the water and the high cost of hand-made golf balls precluding anything that could result in their irrecoverable loss. The land is naturally treeless and this combined with their coastal location makes wind and weather an important factor in links golf. Traditional links courses are often arranged with holes in pairs along the coastline; players would play "out" from the town through a series of holes to the furthest point of the course, and then would return "in" along the second set of holes.[21] The holes may share fairways and sometimes greens (such as at St Andrews to economize on land use, but in modern times this is rare due to the potential for injury from balls coming the other way. Famous links courses include the Old Course at St. Andrews, often described as the "Home of Golf", and Musselburgh Links, which is generally regarded as the first recorded golf course. The Open Championship, the oldest of golf's major championships, is always played on a links course.[22] Links and links-style golf courses have been developed throughout the world, reproducing the broken, treeless terrain with deep bunkers of their Scottish prototypes. An executive course or short course is a course with a total par significantly less than that of a typical 18-hole course. Two main types exist: These types of courses provide a faster pace of play than a standard course, and get their name from their target patronage of business executives who would play the course on a long lunch or as part of a meeting. They are also popular with young professionals, because during the normal golf season, the course can usually be played in the time between the end of the work day and sundown. The popularity of the 9-hole course has waned in recent decades; a full 18-hole course still allows for the player to play only the "front nine" or "back nine" as a shorter game, while attracting more golfers seeking to play a traditional full round of 18 distinct holes. Many older executive courses have been upgraded "in-place" to 18 holes and a traditional par score, or the original course was sold for other development, and new land was acquired and built into an 18-hole course. By contrast, par-3 courses, especially Pitch and Putt, are rising in popularity as a compromise between the long play time and high skill levels required of a traditional 18-hole course, and the artificial nature and single-minded putting focus of miniature golf. Pitch and Putt, specifically its governing association the IPPA, has received financial support and logo rights from the R&A. In 2014, the PGA Tour held a Champions Tour event on a nine-hole par-3 course, the Big Cedar Lodge Legends of Golf in Ridgedale, Missouri, with four (regular division) or three (over-65 division) rounds played over the par-3 course, and one round played on a nearby regulation 18-hole course with par of 71. Pitch and putt is an amateur sport, similar to golf and is also known as chip and putt. The maximum hole length for international competitions is 90 metres (100 yd) with a maximum total course length of 1,200 metres (1,310 yd). Players may only use three clubs; one of which must be a putter. The game is played from raised artificial teeing surfaces using a tee and it has its own handicap system.[23] There are three main categories of ownership and management of a golf course: private, commercial, and municipal.[24] A private course is owned and managed by a golf club on behalf of its members, on a non-profit basis. Many of the courses opened during the golf booms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are of this type.[25] Some courses, such as Augusta National, are highly exclusive and will only allow visitors to play at the invitation of and alongside a member of the club. Others allow visitors at certain times but may insist on advance booking and proof of golfing competency. A commercial course is owned and managed by a private organization and is operated for profit. They may be constructed to provide a core or supplementary attraction for visitors to a hotel or commercial resort, as the centrepiece to a real estate development, as an exclusive Country Club, or as a "Pay and Play" course open to the general public. Notable examples include Pinehurst in the US and Gleneagles in Scotland. A municipal course is owned and managed by a local government body for the benefit of residents and visitors. Some of the historic Scottish golf courses, including St Andrews and Carnoustie fall into this category along with Bethpage and Pebble Beach in the US and many others of less renown. It is increasingly common for the management of municipal courses to be contracted out to commercial or other organisations or the course to be sold or shut down completely.[26] Many commercial and municipal establishments have associated golf clubs, who arrange competitions for their members on the courses and may provide clubhouse facilities. In the UK particularly, some older private members clubs have an associated "Artisan" club, originally established to provide low-cost golf with limited playing rights in exchange for unpaid work on the course.[25] These associated clubs may be totally independent organizations from the course management, or may have various degrees of formal or informal links. As per 2019 there were 38,864 golf courses around the world. A 2019 study[27] revealed that 78% of the world's supply of golf courses are located in 10 countries: the United States, Japan, Canada, England, Australia, Germany, France, South Korea, Sweden and Scotland.[27] Environmental concerns over the use of land for golf courses have grown since the 1960s. Specific issues include the amount of water required for irrigation and the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in maintenance, as well as the destruction of wetlands and other environmentally important areas during construction. These pesticides run off into bodies of water and cause over flowing of pesticides into water which causes algae blooms that destroys whole ecosystem shutdowns. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prohibited the use of Diazinon on golf courses and sod farms because of its negative impact on bird species in 1988.[28][29] The United States Golf Association (USGA) reported in 2012 that in the U.S. golf course irrigation used approximately 2.08 billion gallons of water per day to irrigate its golf courses.[30] The United Nations estimates that, worldwide, golf courses consume about 2.5 billion gallons/9.5 billion litres of water per day.[citation needed] In 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey reported that the state of Utah uses about 38 million gallons of water on its golf courses per day - enough water to fill almost 58 Olympic-sized swimming pools.[31] Studies have also found that golf courses take up 2,244,415 acres of land nationwide. A golf course's carbon footprint is ten times greater than an average person's everyday life.[citation needed] A result of modern equipment is that today's players can hit the ball much farther than previously. As a result, because of demand from course customers who possess this enhanced equipment, and also out of an expressed concern for safety, golf course architects have had to lengthen and widen golf courses. Where a 7,000-yard course used to be a great rarity, courses measuring 7,500-yards are now not uncommon, and courses of 8,000-yards are being contemplated. The cause of modern science allows these specifications that cause more acreage to be used up. All this has led to a ten-percent increase in the acreage required to build a typical course. Environmental concerns, along with concerns about cost and human health, have led to research into more environmentally sound practices and turf grasses. The USGA shares best management practices and case studies of U.S. golf courses, on topics such as irrigation efficiency, use of recycled water, storm water infrastructure, native grasses, and increasing pollinator habitat.[32] Golf course superintendents are often trained in the uses of these practices and grasses. This has led to significant reduction in the amount of water and chemicals on courses. Golf course turf is an excellent filter for water and has been used in communities to cleanse grey water, such as incorporating them into bioswales. The use of natural creeks and ponds is generally desirable when designing a golf course for their aesthetics and the increase in playing difficulty. However, such areas also typically include wetlands within the flood plain that are unsuitable for golfing and are often filled in and raised to remain dry. In arid areas, dry creek beds can be marked as "water hazards", but the importation of non-native grasses and other plant life can have a detrimental effect on native landscapes, often requiring non-native soil and large quantities of water and fertilizer to maintain the course. In these areas, course builders are often prohibited from growing and maintaining non-native grass on areas of the course other than the fairway, or even on the fairway itself, in which case only greens are allowed to have grass. Water restrictions established by communities have forced courses to limit the amount of maintained turf grass. While most modern 18-hole golf courses occupy as much as 60 hectares (150 acres) of land, the average course has 30 hectares (74 acres) of maintained turf.[33][34] Golf courses can be built on sandy areas along coasts, on abandoned farms, among strip mines, and quarries, and in deserts and forests. Many Western countries have instituted environmental restrictions on where and how courses are allowed to be built.[35][36] The problem in today's society with building multibillion-dollar courses is that it takes the place for much better use of land. Those methods of use include building communities for the homeless and under privileged, national parks and forests for tourism, growth of wildlife, and animals to roam free. There is also a problem with giving up farm land which is a top necessity in the US economy which causes problems in the supply chain.[37] In some parts of the world, attempts to build courses and resorts have led to protests, vandalism, and violence. Populists perceive golf as an elitist activity, and thus golf courses become a target for popular opposition. Resisting golf tourism and golf's expansion has become an objective of some land-reform movements, especially in the Philippines and Indonesia.[citation needed] In The Bahamas, opposition to golf developments has become a national issue. Residents of Great Guana Cay and Bimini, for example, are engaged in legal and political opposition to golf developments on their islands, for fear the golf courses will destroy the nutrient-poor balance on which their coral reef and mangrove systems depend.[citation needed] In Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in arid regions, golf courses have been constructed on nothing more than oil-covered sand. Players may use a roller on the "greens" to smooth the intended path before putting. In November 2022, four Saudi Arabian golf courses were certified by the GEO foundation that solidifies those courses pledge and to higher the sustainability in the courses in the area and to improve economic output. This act was supported by very strict laws in Saudi Arabia including stewardship, carbon and climate footprint reduction, and restoration of the economy as well.[39] A course in Coober Pedy, Australia, consists of nine holes dug into mounds of sand, diesel fuel, and oil, with no grass appearing anywhere on the course. Players carry a small piece of astroturf from which they tee the ball. Other Australian golf courses in locations where water is scarce or water conservation is a priority sometimes feature "scrapes" in place of greens. These are made of fine dirt which requires raking between uses but does not require watering.[citation needed] Audubon International has an educational and certification program for golf courses to achieve higher environmental standards and become a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary.[40] The Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA) has developed a program to provide best environmentally sustainable management practices for each state in the U.S.[41] While golf courses are a big contributor to pollution and global warming, there have been good efforts to evolve golf into a game which helps the environment and not the opposite, of destroying it. Golf courses often create large green spaces that serve as habitats for various plants and animals. Some courses incorporate natural features and wildlife corridors, contributing to biodiversity. This is a big step forward in the movement towards a greener environment. Golf courses as a whole also typically require substantial water for irrigation. Properly managed courses can showcase efficient water management practices, such as the use of reclaimed water or sustainable irrigation systems. These are the first crucial stages to conquer environmental issues and the problems within the golf industry. The sustainability issue hits when animals and non-invasive plant life are displaced and there are alteration and distortion to many prominent swamps, wetlands, and other prominent wildlife fixtures.[42] Various people have proposed taking the extensive land used for golf courses and converting that land to affordable housing.[43][44][45] In many states, the method of taxation of the land used for the golf course is controversial. Real and personal property is, in most states, assessed based on fair market value, the value of its "highest and best use." However, in some states golf courses are taxed by current use assessment.[46] The closure of golf courses has increased in recent decades, particularly in the United States, where more than 1,500 facilities shut down during the early 21st century.[47] Similar patterns have been reported in parts of Asia and Australia, where participation rates have declined and the rising cost of land has made golf less financially viable.[48] The closure of these facilities creates a set of ecological and social considerations that vary by region and land management practices. One environmental consequence of abandonment is the spread of invasive species. Without mowing, irrigation, and turf maintenance, fast-growing plants can dominate former fairways and greens, often replacing native vegetation and altering habitat structure.[48] In tropical regions, plant succession can occur rapidly; for example, Chromolaena odorata has been observed to expand across unmanaged land.[48] The discontinuation of pesticide and fertilizer applications may also allow soils and nearby waterways to recover from previous chemical use, although outcomes depend on site conditions and management after closure. Built infrastructure can also deteriorate once maintenance stops. Many golf courses include artificial ponds, canals, and drainage systems designed for irrigation. If left unmanaged, these systems can stagnate, affecting water quality and potentially creating habitats for mosquitoes or other pests.[49] In coastal areas, erosion may increase when turf and stabilizing vegetation die back due to the loss of irrigation. Abandoned courses can influence surrounding communities as well. In residential areas, closed courses are sometimes described as visual blight, and nearby property values may decline following closure.[50] In areas that depend on tourism, abandoned facilities can affect local economies and the image of resort developments. Local governments and homeowners’ associations often face decisions regarding whether to redevelop, conserve, or sell these sites. Some former golf courses have been converted for alternative uses. Documented examples include conversion into public parks, restored wetlands, or community greenways that provide ecological and recreational functions.[47][48][50] In the United States, the American Society of Landscape Architects reported that since 2010 at least 20 defunct courses have been turned into public parks and natural areas.[47] One example is the Rancho Vistoso Golf Club in Oro Valley, Arizona, which closed in 2018 and was converted into a 202-acre nature preserve with hiking trails and native vegetation.[50] Other projects in Florida, Texas, and California have focused on wetland restoration, stormwater management, and the creation of community open space. Research has identified potential environmental benefits from such reuse, including improved stormwater absorption, reduced runoff, and habitat connectivity.[47] The extent of these benefits depends on local ecological conditions and management objectives. Because many golf courses are located in densely developed or flood-prone areas, their reuse has been examined within broader discussions of urban planning and green infrastructure. In some countries, redevelopment takes different forms. In Japan and South Korea, where golf expanded during the late 20th century but later declined, closed courses have been repurposed for solar power installations or agricultural production.[48] These projects illustrate how the outcomes of course closures vary with local policy, economic incentives, and environmental priorities. Although golf facilities have been criticized for high water use, chemical inputs, and land conversion, abandonment and reuse can offer opportunities to mitigate some of these effects. Managing closed courses is part of ongoing discussions on sustainable land use and community planning.[48][50]

The aim is to hit a ball into a hole in as few strokes as possible, using various golf clubs. A round of golf usually consists of 9 to 18 holes, which are played one after the other on a golf course. In Germany, golf, which was developed in Scotland, was long regarded as a predominantly elitist and expensive pastime. In the Anglo-Saxon countries, and to some extent also in neighboring European countries, golf is a leisure sport that is played by a large cross-section of society. This trend has also been clearly recognizable in Germany in recent years. In dialog with golf critics, but also through the easier entry into the sport, new impulses have been set which have enabled further growth. The number of players worldwide is estimated at 50 million. The Scots are generally regarded as the inventors of golf, but there are also a number of other theories that see its origins in continental Europe. Frequently mentioned are Holland (1297: Colf in Loenen aan de Vecht, although this has since been refuted), France (Chole around 1200, Paille-Maille documented from 1416, illustration of a golfer putting on a target stick in the Book of Hours of Adelaïde of Savoy around 1450), Brussels (1360: prohibition of the Colven) and Flanders (illustration of a golfer putting on a hole on ice in a prayer book around 1480). In Gloucester Cathedral there is a stained glass window from 1340 that is said to show a golfer. But there are also references to a game with a ball and clubs in ancient Egypt, ancient Rome (paganica) and early Japan, Korea (tagu, from 1400) and China (chuiwan, from around 1000). Interwoven with the question of the origin of the game is the etymology of the word; particularly due to the work of sports historian Heiner Gillmeister, it is considered likely that the Scottish golf, first attested in 1447, is a borrowing of the Dutch kolv ("club").It is therefore controversial up to what point one must still assume that there are precursors (from which field hockey, croquet, baseball or billiards then also developed) and at what point one can actually speak of golf. Ultimately, this depends on the criteria that are defined as indispensable for the sport of golf. For example, it is only since Pieter van Afferden's Latin textbook of 1545 that it has been established beyond doubt that the player must not be disturbed by the opponent when executing the golf shot. In this respect, the earliest Scottish documents could also refer to a sport which, although called "golf", was more akin to the brutal fighting game of soule or soule à la crosse.On the other hand, of all the early or pre-forms of golf, only the Scottish variant has survived to this day. All other forms of the game disappeared at some point or developed in a different direction - for example, colf became the indoor game of kolf or kolven. The game of golf as we know it today was only introduced or re-imported into all non-British countries in the 19th or 20th century. The first written evidence of golf as we know it today dates back to 1457, when the Scottish Parliament, with King James II as the driving force, banned "ye fut bawe and ye golf" and ordered the practice of archery instead. The ban is reaffirmed by Kings James III (1471) and James IV (1491). It falls victim to the peace treaty between Scotland and England in 1502, which makes paramilitary exercises no longer appropriate for the population. Soon afterwards, it becomes known that James IV himself plays golf when an invoice for golf clubs made for him appears in the court's official budget. Thanks to royal support, golf spread throughout Great Britain in the 16th century. The first civic golfer is mentioned in 1527, a certain Sir Robert Maule is said to have played on the Barry Links near modern Carnoustie. The first reference to golf in St Andrews dates back to 1552, the following year the Archbishop issued a decree allowing the local population to play on the links. Mary Stuart subsequently introduced the sport to France. She is also known to have played golf in 1567, immediately after the assassination of her husband, for which she was widely criticized. The first golf club maker is documented in 1603, when William Mayne is appointed "Royal Clubmaker" by King James VI. The "featherie", a leather ball filled with feathers, comes into play in 1618. The first mention of golf in America is a ban on the game in the streets of Albany, New York, in 1659. The first international match takes place in Leith in 1682, when Scotland (represented by the Duke of York and John Paterson) defeats an unnamed English duo. It is in this context that the first caddie becomes known, an Andrew Dickson carrying the Duke of York's clubs. In 1691, St Andrews is described in a private letter as the "Metropolis of golfing". The first documented ladies' tournament is held in Musselburgh (10 km east of Edinburgh) in 1810, and the first ladies' golf club is formed in St Andrews in 1867. Outside the British Isles, the first club was founded in Bangalore in 1820, while continental Europe started in Pau in 1856. The hickory shaft prevails over other types of wood from 1826, and the steel shaft comes onto the market in 1891. From 1848, the featherie was replaced by the gutta-percha ball, which flew further and was cheaper to produce. For the same reasons, the gutta-percha ball had to give way to the Haskell ball, a wrapped hard rubber core, in 1898. The Open Championship, the oldest tournament still played today, celebrates its premiere in Prestwick in 1860. Young Tom Morris made the first recorded hole in one in 1867. the Darmstadt Golf Club, the first club in Germany, was founded in 1892; British spa guests had been playing in the Bad Homburg spa gardens since 1889, while a group of young Germans led by Philipp Heineken played in the Neckar meadows near Cannstatt from 1890. The USGA was founded in 1894, the Stableford scoring system was invented in 1898 and the wooden tee was patented in 1899. Golf is an Olympic sport at the 1900 and 1904 Games. grooves appear on the club face in 1902, dimples on the golf ball in 1905, but center-shafted putters are withdrawn from play by the R&A in 1910 and steel shafts in 1911. The German Golf Association begins business in 1907. The PGA of America is formed in 1916 as the first representative body for professional golfers. Steel shafts are permitted everywhere again from 1929 and finally replace hickory shafts. The upper limit of 14 clubs per player and round is applied for the first time in 1938. The R&A and USGA agree on a joint set of rules in 1951, at the same time stymies are abolished and center-shafted putters are permitted again. In 1963, the rubber grip (previously leather) and cast irons (previously forged) make their debut, followed by the graphite shaft and cavity back irons in 1969. The only two golf shots on the moon to date were made by astronaut Alan Shepard in 1971. The first metal driver heads are launched in 1979, replacing Persimmon wood. Titanium is introduced to the American market as a material for woods in 1994 and subsequently establishes itself. in 2009, the IOC decides that golf should be an Olympic sport again from 2016: A decision based on the worldwide grassroots and elite sports work, the association structures, which are considered exemplary, and the many golf game variants as well as entry-level options such as cross golf. The culture of "downsizing" in particular - characteristic of every mass sport - was a key aspect in determining the future Olympic sport. The first written rules date back to 1744 by the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith. However, the modern rules of golf originated with the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (R&A), founded in 1754. Today they are published jointly by the R&A and the USGA. The current version is valid from 1 January 2012 until the end of 2014 and introduced a number of changes that mainly serve to clarify and standardize the rules. A special feature of golf is the very large and largely natural playing area (the so-called golf course), which means that the rules have to cover a wide range of conceivable situations. For this reason, the 34 rules are more detailed than those of most other sports, and even experienced players are occasionally unsure which rule to apply in a particular case. Each national golf association (in Germany the DGV) has an expert commission for this purpose, which answers disputed questions about the rules if it considers the facts to be clear. If this is not the case, the R&A or the USGA is ultimately asked for a so-called "decision", i.e. an official interpretation of the rules. Like the Rules of Golf themselves, the decisions are also published (on more than 800 pages) and are part of the rules in the broader sense. Furthermore, the additional appendices in the rule book, in which topics such as "shape of clubs" or "nature of the ball" are defined, are also part of the rules. In addition, the above-mentioned "general" golf rules for competitions are specified in the "competition conditions" (definition of modalities for the execution of competitions) or by "course rules" (regulation of golf course-specific features). The aim is to play a ball (minimum diameter 42.67 mm, maximum weight 45.93 grams) with as few golf shots as possible from an area designated as a tee into a circular hole with a diameter of 10.8 cm, usually several hundred meters away, in accordance with the rules of golf. The golf course usually comprises 9 to 18 holes, which can be over 7,000 meters long in total. If the ball cannot be played according to the rules (for example, because it can no longer be found or has sunk into a pond), the rules of golf provide for certain possibilities of resumption, but usually with the addition of penalty strokes. The sum of the strokes until the ball is put into the hole (golf strokes + penalty strokes) is called the score and is noted on a pre-prepared score sheet, the so-called score card. A par is defined for each fairway (also known as a "hole"). This value represents the average number of strokes required by a very good player (a scratch golfer with a 0 handicap) to drive the ball from the tee into the hole. When calculating the par for a fairway, it is always assumed that two putts are made on the green. A certain number of strokes is then added for the play from the tee to the green. This number varies with the length of the hole, not with its difficulty, which is also given by bunkers, hills, water, etc. and is specified separately as course and slope rating.The R&A Rules of Golf use the term "par", but do not specify how exactly the par of a hole is determined; this is left to the national associations. The DGV currently uses the following length classifications (as of July 2010): 3 up to 192 m up to 229 m 4 193 to 366 m 230 to 430 m 5 from 367 m from 431 m In justified individual cases, a classification deviating from this scheme is also possible (e.g. in the case of particularly steep slopes), but this must be applied for separately by the respective golf club and approved by the DGV. If a player's ball lies on the green with "par minus 2" strokes, this is referred to as a "green in regulation". An 18-hole course often has four par 3 holes, ten par 4s and four par 5s. This usually results in a par of 72 for the entire round. For 9-hole courses, these figures are halved accordingly, whereby there are many short courses, especially among the 9-hole courses, which consist mainly of par-3 holes. The following terms have become established for the various possible scores on a hole: Ace, hole-in-one A shot that sends the ball directly from the tee into the hole Double Albatross four shots under par Albatross (English (UK): albatross, English (USA): double-eagle) three shots under par Eagle two shots under par Birdie (birdie) one shot under par Par or even exactly par Bogey one over par Double bogey two over par Triple bogey three over par There are two basic forms of play in competitions, namely counting play and hole play, each of which has several variants. In the counting game, it is the score achieved in comparison to the rest of the field of participants that counts. As there is no direct opponent, this is often referred to as a game against the course. This is not the case with hole play, where the aim is to beat a particular opponent by winning more holes (i.e. finishing the respective hole with a lower score) than the opponent.There are two ways of counting for both forms of play, namely gross (the score actually played is decisive) and net (the score played is adjusted to compensate for the different skill levels of the participants). This means that the gross table results in the absolute best golfer and the net counting method determines the best player in relative terms, i.e. the player who was most successful in comparison to their personal playing strength.A widely used variant of the counting game in Germany is the Stableford counting game. This form of play is also used to determine the handicaps of golfers organized in the German Golf Association (DGV). The handicap indicates the factor by which the score actually played is adjusted in a net rating and is intended to enable an exciting competition between opponents of different skill levels. In other countries, the handicaps are sometimes determined by the local golf associations using different methods, meaning that they are sometimes only roughly comparable. All over the world, however, a "bogey golfer" is understood to be an advanced amateur who averages one stroke over par, whereas a "scratch golfer" plays around par and is considered a professional, at least in terms of playing ability. A beginner golfer is commonly referred to as a "rabbit". According to the current rules of golf, players can take up to 14 clubs with them on a round of golf. The clubs differ in the length of the shaft (measured in inches in golf), loft, design and material. Basically, the trajectory of the ball is controlled by the loft and the shaft length: the more loft, the higher and shorter the trajectory; the longer the club, the more it can be accelerated and the further the ball flies. The woods are used for the tee shot and the long shots (range from 180 m) on the fairway. They are the longest clubs and have the largest club head, which is hollow and, despite its name, is no longer made of wood. Most players have a wood 1 (also known as a driver) in their bag and one to three more woods for shorter distances (woods 3, 5, 7). For medium-length shots (70-180 m), clubs called irons are used, which allow more accurate shots compared to the woods. Irons are the most flexible clubs to use. It is perfectly possible to play a round of golf with only half a set of irons. Hybrid or rescue clubs are a mixture of irons and woods, offering a compromise between the length of a wood and the accuracy of an iron. Normally a player has no more than one or two hybrid clubs. These are usually used as a replacement for a long iron. Wedges are used for short shots around the green (under 100 m) or for very difficult situations (bunkers, ditches, high grass). They are similar to irons, but are shorter and have more loft. A standard set includes at least the pitching wedge and the sand wedge. There is also the gap wedge and the lob wedge. The putter is used to hole the ball on the green. Playing with this club is called putting. The ball does not fly through the air as with the other clubs, but rolls over the green. The putter is particularly important as it is used more often than any other club (the par standard assumes two putts per hole), yet there is only one putter in almost every golf bag. The size and composition of a golf ball are defined in the rules of golf. The diameter of a golf ball is at least 42.67 mm, the maximum weight is 45.93 g. The surface of the ball is provided with approx. 300 to 500 dimples (small dents). Almost every manufacturer has a different arrangement of dimples to optimize the trajectory.A golf ball consists of a hard plastic shell (gutta-percha was used in the past) with different cores. In addition to hard rubber cores, multi-layer cores made of various flexible materials are increasingly being used. Depending on the number of different layers, we speak of 2-piece, 3-piece, 4-piece (and so on) balls. Most golf balls have a number printed on them. This is used to distinguish the ball from other players' balls if they are using a ball of the same brand and type.The trajectory of a golf ball is determined by gravitational and aerodynamic forces.The angle of the club head causes the ball to rotate during impact, which contributes to the necessary directional stability during flight. Every golf shot triggers a backward spin if the ball is hit with the club face. The different trajectories are triggered by additional lateral rotations. The so-called dimples on the surface reduce the flow resistance coefficient by lowering the pressure resistance and reduce the air resistance by up to 50 %. Depending on the player's hitting technique, a golf ball can fly up to four times farther.Golf balls are elastic. Due to the so-called smash, they store energy on contact with the club, which they release again when hit. Without smash, the tee speed would be limited to the speed of the club. With smash, it increases by a maximum of 1.5 times. Good golfers reach ball speeds of 250 km/h, the record is 328 km/h. A trolley is used to conveniently transport a golf bag containing the set of golf clubs and other utensils (balls, rainwear, drinks, food, etc.) that are useful during the game of golf around the golf course. A golf trolley usually also has an umbrella and scorecard holder.A distinction is made between Golf is played on a golf course. This usually has 9 to 18 fairways (also known as holes), each consisting of the basic elements tee, fairway and green. The course is planned by a golf architect and managed by a golf club or a commercial operating company. The maintenance of a golf course is very complex and requires several greenkeepers and a range of special machinery. The maintenance costs depend on the quality of the course and range from 300,000 to 900,000 euros per year for most courses. For a long time, golf was a sport that had a fairly high barrier to entry due to the time and capital investment required (similar to riding, sailing or flying). One reason for this was that building and maintaining a golf course is very expensive, which was then passed on to members in the form of high admission and annual fees. In addition, the extensive equipment used to be relatively expensive as it had to be imported from England.Today, this has largely changed as there are now many public golf courses and equipment can be purchased through a variety of channels. On the one hand in specialist shops (golf shops are normal, generally profit-oriented service companies. In addition, most private golf clubs have opened their courses to day visitors, although they reserve the right to impose various access restrictions. In particular, of course, the aim is to enable members who pay their membership fees to play in an orderly manner, which could otherwise prove problematic, especially at weekends. In Germany, Austria, Switzerland and a few other countries, permission to play on a golf course is dependent on obtaining the so-called Platzreife (PR) or Platzerlaubnis (PE), which can be acquired in PE courses. This is where the basics of the game and golf etiquette are learned. It is important to note that this PE is only valid for the respective golf club; another golf club does not have to recognize it. In many cases, you need a handicap to be allowed to play on other courses, and it is often also required that the handicap has been assigned by a specific golf association (e.g. one that is a member of the European Golf Association). Many clubs also require you to have a minimum handicap at peak times (often -36 or better at weekends) or only allow you to tee off when accompanied by a member.In Germany, you can also have a handicap outside of a traditional golf club, for example as a member of the VcG. The Vereinigung clubfreier Golfspieler (VcG) enables its members to play golf without having to join a club. There is a similar organization in Switzerland, the ASGI. Furthermore, many golf clubs offer so-called long-distance memberships for players who do not live in the respective catchment area. Although the right to play freely on the home course is sometimes restricted, the membership fees are considerably lower. There are also a number of smaller providers who sell even cheaper foreign memberships or handicap management without being tied to a golf course or golf association. However, some golf course operators exclude customers of these organizations as guest players or charge them higher green fees. The green fee is the fee to be paid by a golfer to play on a golf course.In Scandinavia and the traditional vacation regions for golfers (Spain, Portugal, North Africa, Turkey), guests are welcome almost everywhere, but the requirement of a minimum handicap is not yet being abandoned across the board. In the Anglo-American countries, on the other hand, golf is a popular sport and there are a large number of publicly accessible courses that can be played for the sole payment of a green fee. On the other hand, there are also many very exclusive and purely private clubs in the USA, which only allow guests to play when accompanied by a club member.

Promise. © 2025 National Club Golfer | 2 Arena Park, Tam Lane, LS17 9BF published: Feb 27, 2024 updated: Jul 31, 2024 Matt Coles How many clubs can I carry? Can I pick up and clean my ball? Can I tee my ball up anywhere? Here are some of the rules that beginner golfers have to know! Jump to: For golfers just starting out, learning the Rules of Golf can be just as difficult as consistently putting a clubhead on to the ball. How many clubs can you carry? What happens when you lose your golf ball? Our very own Hannah Holden took the time to explain some of the key golf rules for beginners, and why they’re so important for new players to get to grips with them. You can watch the video below, or scroll on down to see a baker’s dozen of important rules and golf etiquette revealed… Yes, there is a limit! You can only carry a maximum of 14 clubs. You can choose to carry less, but have any more than 14 in the bag and you’ll be getting a penalty. How do you start playing a hole? By playing a ball from anywhere inside the teeing area. A ball is classed as being in that area if any part of it touches or is above part of the teeing area. You can use a tee, or you can play it from the ground, and you’re under way when you make a stroke to begin the hole. This bit is important. A stroke is defined as the forward movement of the club made to strike the ball. So, even if you miss it entirely, it counts a stroke. Add one to your score. No. The only time you can place the ball on a tee is when you are in the teeing area. Everywhere else on the golf course, the ball must normally be played as it lies – whether that is in the fairway, rough, bunker, or on the green. What if you can’t find your ball? Once a three minute search time has elapsed, you’ll have to take stroke-and-distance relief. That means going back to where you played your previous shot and hitting another ball. Advertisement For instance, you’ve hit your drive offline and you can’t find your ball in the rough. If you haven’t already played a provisional ball, you would have to go back to the teeing area and put another ball into play. This is now your third shot, as you’ve hit off the tee, incurred a penalty stroke for taking stroke-and-distance relief, and have played from the tee once more. You have made it on to the green, but does your golf bag come with you? We don’t want to put it in the way, or too far out of the way so we are slowing down golfers behind. If you can, always try and put your golf bag between the flag and the next tee, so it is on your way as you leave the putting surface. Just make sure your bag never goes on the green! Ah, the honour. Traditionally, the person with the lowest gross score on the previous hole is the first player to tee off. As the hole develops, the player who is furthest from the hole usually players first. Many golfers, though, adopt a mantra of ‘ready golf’. If someone else in the group is ready, and it is safe to play, they can hit their shot to keep the game moving. The greens are usually the most receptive bits of turf on the golf course. These can also mean a golf ball coming from a high trajectory can cause marks and indentations in the ground. If you get to the green and find your ball has done this then it is correct etiquette repair it. Normally you’ll use a pitch mark repairer but you can also use a tee. Advertisement This is done to make sure the green is in as good a shape as possible for the next group, and there are no big indentations after you’ve finished the hole that can damage the putting surface if left unattended. Yes, you are allowed to mark your ball and clean it before putting. You can place your ball marker behind the ball, you can use a tee if you wish, and you can then lift the ball. When you’re done, place the ball back on the same spot, remove the marker, and away you go! When you are on the green, does the flagstick have to stay in the hole? This is entirely your choice. You can putt with the flag in. You can also remove it. If you’re a long way from the hole, you can ask a playing partner to ‘attend the flag’. This means they hold the flagstick until the ball gets closer to the hole, and then remove it. If the ball hits the flagstick, or the person attending it, a penalty will ensue if that was done deliberately. This happens more than you might think! You’re not allowed to play from a wrong green and must take relief. You need to find the nearest point of complete relief from interference from the wrong green – that includes stance and area of intended swing – it that can be no nearer the hole you are playing. You drop the ball, from knee height, into a one-club relief area. Most clubs will only allow a maximum of four people in a group. If you are in a fourball and there are ones and twos behind, the Rules say players are encouraged to allow faster groups to play through. Step to the side and wave them on. Advertisement Despite the changes to the Rules of Golf in 2019 and 2023, there are still some that leave us scratching our heads. I’ll try to help by featuring the best of your queries in this column. Did you know all these golf rules for beginners? Would there be any other beginner golf rules that you would add when it comes to beginner golfers learning the game? Let us know with a post on X. Advertisement No comments yet.

Tags: Golf Costa del Golf is packed with over 70 golf courses and clubs, as well as a pleasant climate that lets golf lovers play golf any day of the year. If you’ve never played golf before, there are some rules and terms you should become familiar with. Check them out below, then schedule a lesson or a round of golf on the Costa del Golf! In golf, the amount of points you get directly correlates to the number of strokes it takes you to get the ball in the hole. The fewer strokes you take, the better. At the end of each hole, each player tallies the number of strokes he or she took on that hole. At the end of all the holes, the player that took the least amount of strokes wins. Don’t start a game without first making sure you’ve chosen a course that meets your skill level. Here’s a quick guide to the four different types of courses: Red: Beginning female golfers (basic and intermediate) Blue: Competition-level women (advanced) Yellow: Beginning male golfers (basic and intermediate) White: Competition-level golfers (advanced; male and female) There are different kinds of golf tees: wooden tees, plastic stepped tees (12 mm, 24 mm or 37 mm), one-tees and little one-tees. Tees can only be used at the start of each hole. You have to figure out the right height of the tee, where the ball should be placed and where you need to stand in relation to the tee. If the tee is too low, you risk hitting just the top of the ball, which won’t get you very far. If your tee is too high, you’ll hit the ball from the bottom, thus sending it straight into the air and reducing how far out the ball could actually travel. This sport requires concentration, so silence and stillness are key when someone is at the tee. Give players plenty of space and avoid moving around as much as possible. Your best bet is to stand across from the player who is at the tee so that you can see where his or her ball lands once it’s hit. Within a hole, the player who hit the ball farthest goes first. 90% of the balls used are white, but all of them are numbered. Before you start, look at the number on your ball and write it down. You can also mark your ball or choose a ball that’s a different colour from your opponents so you don’t get confused. If you hit a ball outside the limits of the course, play a second ball. The first hit will be counted as a penalty stroke. If your ball has fallen behind a tree, in a bush or somewhere else you can’t access, you have two options: you can move the ball a distance of two golf clubs from where it is (but not in the direction that’s closer to the hole) or you can grab a new ball and hit it again from the starting point of your last shot. Both options will result in a penalty stroke. When you hit your ball in a sand bunker, you have two options. If the ball is still playable, try to hit it out of the bunker! If it can’t be played, use the same guidelines as in the above point. As a courtesy, rake the sand to smooth it out when you’re done. You have two options! If you’re in the part of the course with the red pegs, you can replay the ball from the point of the previous shot, move the ball along the line between the obstacle’s entry point and the flag (but not towards the flag) or move the ball a distance of two clubs from where the ball entered the obstacle. A penalty stroke will be taken for either choice. If the water hazard is in the centre part of the course or the part with the yellow pegs, you can move the ball along the line between the obstacle’s entry point and the flag (but not towards the flag) or go back and re-hit the previous shot. A penalty stroke will be taken for either choice. Being on the green comes with specific rules. They are: A hole is always started by the player who won the previous hole. Now that you know the basics, it’s time to play! When you play golf on the Costa del Golf, you’ll have access to a range of professionals who can answer any questions you may have. (For example: What golf club should you use? Or, how can you improve your swing? It’s normal for amateur golfers to have questions—so don’t hesitate to ask!).

Home » Golf Instruction There is one key fundamental in the Rotary Swing, the first building block to learning the swing: body rotation. As its name makes clear, the Rotary Swing is more rotational rather than vertical. But what's the correct way to rotate the body? The answer is twofold. First, the shoulders should always rotate perpendicular to your spine. Rather than tilt, your shoulders should turn around a fixed spinal angle. The easiest way to visualize this is to stand up straight and turn your shoulders back and through with a club across your chest. The shaft should always rotate level to the ground. The second key is to remember your "ABTs." What is ABT? "Always be turning." Because the golf swing is rotational in nature, it depends on the rotating body for power and control. When the body stops turning at any point in the golf swing, the arms have a chance to take over, and inconsistency is the result. So remember your ABTs and you'll have the key to the Rotary Swing down. January 8, 2007 Paul Faley wrote on: Jul 18, 2013 I am a Premium Member, & a senior golfer. In the past, I have had lessons from good teachers, but not emphasis on the above two subjects. I was taught to pause at the top of the backswing which seems contrary to RST methods. Learning the above two issues, & eliminating the pause, seems like a lot to learn all at the same time. What do you suggest as the best method to help in my learning process? Thanks. Reply To improve your swing, you must know why the ball does what it does in flight. That way you at least know what really caused the errant shot and perhaps can make the correct fix.

Australian Golf Digest Late at night, when normal human beings are sleeping, one writer spends literal hours on Reddit Golf, a treasure trove of humor, whining, equipment scores, outright lies and occasionally some great advice. It also led him, once upon a time, to Bucket Hat Guy. Each Friday, he will bring the site’s best content to you, so that you can live a normal life. One of the most challenging things in any walk of life, golf included, is when you feel like everybody else is catching on faster than you, and that you suck in a more permanent and essential way than everyone you know. I used to feel this way about golf, and in fact felt it for a very long time, but then I broke 80 and now feel like I’m only a few chipping lessons from the PGA Tour. I’m not saying I’d win a major or anything, but I definitely now believe that I could be a beloved journeyman type. However, I took up darts two years ago, and that has now occupied the place in my life where I’m constantly wondering how I can be so ****ing bad at something. I play in an online league with five divisions, and I’m stuck in the lowest division, trying and usually failing to fight my way out. Meanwhile, newer people take it up and seem immediately way better than me, and at least one of my friends who started at the same time is way, way better. It’s DUMB. RELATED: PGA Tour caddie witnesses a golfer’s darkest moment while taking out the trash And you know what? It’s really tempting to think everyone else is cheating and/or lying. This week on Reddit Golf, u/zelkoo got fed up with reading about other beginners hitting the course and immediately thriving. In a post titled “Are the so called ‘beginners’ of this sub completely different to what I am as a beginner and what I see other beginners doing on the course?’, he asked: Everyone here seems to be a golfing prodigy, hitting bombs on a regular basis and breaking 80 two months after starting with golf. It took me MONTHS to even make solid contact with a club and get some distance. My swing progresses because I take lessons and my instructor is happy with my progress. But here everyone seems to figure everything out straight after starting lol. I get it, zelkoo—the feeling that some people improve much faster than you is absolutely the worst, and those people deserve to be in prison. Not only that, but this is online, so it’s almost certainly correct that the landscape is populated by a bunch of weirdo liars who puff themselves up for reasons we can’t begin to psychoanalyze. AND YET! It’s also an annoying fact that there are natural athletes out there, or people who aren’t really that athletic who happen to have great golf coordination, and they’re going to be better quicker than the rest of us. RELATED: Michael Block sensibly explains why he’s not cut out for the PGA Tour, internet pounces It’s a true mixed bag, and the top comment, from u/BoxingRaptor (great name) was probably the wisest reply: Many people vastly overestimate how far/well they hit it, and many more either don’t know how to keep an accurate score, or just willfully make numbers up, because they think it makes them look good to a bunch of Internet randos. Just play your game, and ignore the noise. 100% right. I also liked this bullseye from u/bonemonkey12: It’s reddit man, what do you think? Along with that sagacious advice came some support from the hordes of beginners who also continue to be terrible at golf. jt94: I started going to the driving range a year ago with 0 previous golfing experience. Joined a course, played a few rounds this year, bought a package set and have had a few lessons. Contrary to the others in this sub, I have yet to hit a clean 200 yard drive. I haven’t broke 100 yet. I’ve never had a birdie. Despite all this, I am quite happy with where I’ve got to in a year. Comparison is the thief of joy as they say… Carefree14: I started golfing this year. I’d swung a club at the range a couple of times before, but never really did anything serious. Never taken lessons. My first 18, I quit keeping score after about 120. It was ugly. Couldn’t hit a driver, lost at least a dozen balls, hit one fairway because I teed off with an iron, and you can forget about a GIR. Now I hit one in every three drives cleanly and around 230 yards, the other two have a wicked slice and get lost in the woods. Distance isn’t great, but it’s improving. I two putt occasionally, and three putt frequently, but almost never four putt anymore. I chunk and skull more iron shots than I care to admit, but the ball progresses now instead of flying sideways off the toe of the club. I’ve made three honest to God pars, and way fewer triple and quadruple bogeys. My best score over 18 is still only 116. Hope this helps give you a little more honest perspective on how other beginners are doing. DeathMetalGolfer: I started golfing a year ago and today I’m a scratch golfer about join the Korn ferry tour. Is that quick? ….i feel you OP, love this sub but I feel exactly like you sometimes. The progression is all sports now seems crazy tho, kids are becoming prodigy’s out of high school playing at a level most college athletes finish with. Fireblade09: I can make okay contact about 30% of the time. The other 70% is either chunk up enough dirt to make a WW1 trench, top it harder than a pornstar, or missile it so far into the rough that it could be considered an international war crime. My short game sucks, and the other day I skulled it so hard on the chipping green that it ended up on the first tee box. When I go play a course, I waste enough money on balls to fund another US invasion of the Middle East….So no. There are beginners just as bad if not worse than you on this sub. RELATED: How far do average golfers *really* hit it? New distance data will surprise you Beyond the support, others cut to the heart of human nature…especially human online nature. Driss12344432: Played with a random who said he had a friend who can hit his pitching wedge 200 yards. The amount of people who just straight up lie is crazy. LitterBoxServant: Breaking 80 on this sub is the same as breaking 100 legitimately Solar_Power2417: …everybody here is lying or exaggerating except for you and me… and I’m beginning to wonder about you… [name redacted]: Half of all reddit posts are just weird people practicing their creative writing skills. mbasi: The like button as a feature has completely ruined us. So where does that leave us? Well, some people are definitely lying, but as far as the original poster goes, the fact that it took him “months” to make solid contact means that, yeah, there are unfortunately people that will be legitimately better in a shorter time. That is, as they say, life. And to reuse a phrase that appeared in a couple comments, “comparison is the thief of joy.” If someone’s better than you, who cares? If someone’s lying about being better than you, who cares? What’s beautiful about golf is that you can compete, for a lifetime, against yourself. That’s the only metric for improvement you need, and it’s probably the only one you should seek, since there are always going to be lots and lots of people better than us. So forget them all, and just go out and have fun. And by “have fun,” I mean continue to get ridiculously angry and frustrated by this game, but do so because you’re a failure and a loser by your own standards, not somebody else’s. When it comes to golf, that’s the one true path. Previously: What do you do when your spouse doesn’t like you playing golf? Don’t be the range police!

Don't worry, you can easily switch back at any time and will see a new button at the top of your screen to switch back whenever you like. What are the main advantages of the new program? There's a reason that Earl Woods taught Tiger how to play the game from the green back. I admit, at first, even I didn't think it was necessary. I thought I could skip ahead and learn the full swing without building a solid foundation in putting, chipping and pitching. All this belief did was cost me MORE time than had I started at the beginning just like The GOAT did. Over the past 20 years of doing golf clinics, my observations of thousands of students was always the same - those who started the slowest at the beginning always got there the fasted in the end. In other words, the students I observed being diligent with the small things like grip, setup, posture and the basics of controlling the clubface on day 1 were always WAY further ahead of those who didn't on day 1. In the post above by member Everett, he said it all in a nutshell. Go through the program exactly the way it is laid out and you will have extraordinary results. Skip to the end and you'll end up with the exact same swing you started with. This is a system, not a grouping of random tips. There is a method to my madness deeply rooted in learning psychology and over 30 years of teaching hundreds of thousands of golfers just like you how to hit a ball with a stick.

Last Updated on December 26, 2023 by Matt Golfers love rules and some guys can be real sticklers for them. By that, I mean they have arguments and carry a pocket rule book to prove they're right over the tiniest of innocent infringements. That's a minority of guys but generally we all like to play by the book as best we can. I've summarized the basic rules of golf for beginners most to ensure you don't commit any mortal sins on the course. If you follow these basics, you'll be invited back! In the beginning, it's intimidating, but most people will understand you're new but learn the basic rules of golf and you're set for your journey. Note that I'm covering the rules for strokeplay. That means you count all your shots and must put the ball in the hole to complete the hole. Matchplay is a different form of the game, but I promise, you'll only need to know those rules about 2 years after you start playing. If any part of the ball is touching the green, it means you're on the green and can put a marker behind the ball and pick it up to clean. Well done! You can take a look at the full rules of golf at the USGA and R&A websites. Last Updated on December 26, 2023 by Matt Copyright text 2025 by Golf Sidekick.

Being a beginning golfer is one of the most terrifying experiences in sports. The game should be as simple as hitting a ball with a stick, but we all know golf is so much more than that. There are so many rules and so much unspoken etiquette that many people new to the game feel intimidated and overwhelmed. We get it. We were there once, too. Learning the ins and outs of the game isn't easy, but it also isn't insurmountable. There are potentially years of enjoyment ahead, so if you're willing to handle the steep learning curve at the beginning, then you will be richly rewarded down the line. We reached out to two executives with First Tee - a non-profit organization that every year teaches thousands of children the game's fundamentals, as well as life skills - to get their perspective on the five rules every beginning golfer should know. Interestingly, their advice varied widely, proving that golf means different things to different people. You can play for competition, for fun, for exercise, for social reasons. You can follow the rules as loosely or as strict as you wish. It's all fair game whether you're learning or a lifelong veteran. Nobody in the golf industry cares what you shoot. We just want you to have enough fun that you come again soon. When we asked about the five rules every beginner should know, Julie Steinbauer Leventhal, the program director at First Tee – Central Florida in Orlando, took a step-by-step approach to get beginners started. She offered this advice: Rule 1: Tee markers are on the tee box where you start the hole. Choose a tee box to play from the entire round. Typically, they are different colors, and you can choose a closer or farther set of tees from the hole for your round. Most beginners start closer to the hole. You must tee up your ball between and behind the markers. Rule 2: Play your ball as it lies, meaning wherever your shot ends up, you must hit from there! Unless… Rule 3: You end up out of bounds or in a penalty area. Out of bounds is shown through white stakes or lines, and red and yellow stakes or lines show penalty areas. Out of bounds or lost balls must be replayed from your last spot with a penalty shot. Red and yellow penalty areas each have their own rules for dropping near the water (or hazard) with a penalty stroke. Rule 4: Whoever is further away from the hole goes first (and it’s a good idea to give them space and stand behind or to the side of them.) Rule 5: Once you get to the green, you can mark your ball by placing the mark behind the ball and picking it up. This helps keep it out of the way of others, and you can clean your ball, and line it up towards your target. Bonus Rule: At the end of the round shake hands and say 'nice playing with you'. It’s not an official rule, but it is expected! Mike Firpo, the director of programs at First Tee – Greater Sacramento, took the approach of offering tips based on a beginner playing with friends or people with whom they are comfortable. "It is not a good idea to just show up and play your first round with strangers," he noted. His tips skew more toward philosophies, but I actually like that more than worrying about specific rules. Rule 1: Ignore your score. It is good to understand that for your first round(s) of golf you should not be concerned about scores for each hole. Rule 2: Keep up and pick up. (It's important to) understand pace of play and limit the number of strokes taken getting from tee to green so you don’t slow down the group or the rest of the golfers around you. Do the same on the green. If you pick up in the fairway, place your ball near a playing partner and watch their putt, then try to do the same or better. After two putts, pick up. Rule 3: Know your abilities. Play mainly higher lofted clubs from the fairway if needed. Higher lofted clubs such as a 7 or 8 iron are easier to get in the air and hit more solidly. A short shot that is hit well, feels better than topping a long iron or metal wood. Rule 4: Stay out of the way. Ask playing partners to assist you with where to stand, order of play, where to walk on the greens, etc. Playing partners will appreciate your interest in learning and be more likely to offer guidance if you ask. Rule 5: Smile! Enjoy the experience, shake hands with everyone and thank them for their patience and understanding. Golf is supposed to be fun.

Golf is an exciting sport that enjoys great popularity around the world. However, for many beginners, the rules of the game can seem like a complex and daunting maze. Don’t worry, in this article we will guide you through the 5 basic rules that every player should know to start enjoying golf to the fullest. The main objective of golf is to complete an 18-hole course using the fewest strokes possible. Each hole has an assigned par, which represents the number of strokes an average player should need to complete it. The player who completes the course with the fewest total strokes wins the game. To play golf, you will need a set of golf clubs, a golf ball, and a tee. Golf clubs are used to hit the ball, and each one has a specific function. The golf ball is a small white sphere that is hit with the clubs. The tee is a small piece of plastic or wood that is placed on the ground to elevate the ball before the first shot of each hole. In golf, each stroke a player makes is counted. At the end of each hole, the player adds up the number of strokes they have used and writes their score on a scorecard. The player with the lowest total score at the end of the course wins the game. Golf is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. With a little practice and knowledge of the basic rules, you will be well on your way to becoming a successful golfer.

If you’re new to golf, it's beneficial to familiarize yourself with the basic rules and etiquette of the game. By doing so, you'll feel more confident and enjoy your time on the course. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamental rules of golf, help you avoid common penalties, and provide insights into golf etiquette. Let's dive in! Golf may seem intimidating at first, but understanding the basic rules will help you feel more at ease on the course. In this section, we will explore the seven primary rule categories and delve into the essential rules within each that every golfer should be familiar with. One of the essential principles of golf is to play the ball as it lies. This means you shouldn't move, touch, or alter the ball's position unless the rules allow it. Playing the ball as it lies helps maintain the integrity and fairness of the game. Similarly, you should play the course as you find it. Avoid altering the course (e.g., breaking branches or smoothing bunkers) to gain an advantage. As a golfer, it's your responsibility to know and follow the rules. Always act with integrity and call penalties on yourself if necessary.

If your ball goes beyond these boundaries, it's considered "out of bounds," and you'll need to take a penalty stroke and replay the shot from the original position. Golf courses have various natural and artificial conditions, such as trees, rocks, and cart paths. If your ball lands in an abnormal course condition, you may be entitled to relief (i.e., moving the ball without penalty). Familiarize yourself with the specific rules regarding obstructions and relief to avoid unnecessary penalties. Penalty areas include water hazards (lakes, ponds, etc.) and other designated areas where playing the ball might be difficult. Hitting a ball into a penalty area usually results in a one-stroke penalty, and you'll have several options for taking relief. There are two main formats in golf: match play and stroke play. In match play, golfers compete on a hole-by-hole basis, while in stroke play, the total number of strokes for the entire round determines the winner. Know the format you're playing and how to score it correctly. Playing in the correct order, or "honors," is essential in golf. In stroke play, the player with the lowest score on the previous hole tees off first. In match play, the winner of the previous hole has the honor. During the rest of the hole, the ball farthest from the hole is played first. In match play, players can concede a hole or stroke to their opponent. If you believe your opponent has breached a rule, you can make a claim. Make sure to understand the procedures for making claims and concessions. Golfers are allowed to carry a maximum of 14 clubs in their bag during a round. Carrying more than 14 clubs can result in a penalty. Ensure that your clubs and balls meet the specifications outlined by golf's governing bodies (USGA and R&A). Using non-conforming equipment can result in disqualification. Be aware of the rules regarding the use of equipment, such as rangefinders, club covers, and towels. Some devices and actions may be prohibited or restricted during play. Time to upgrade your equipment? Check out Stix Complete Golf Club Sets → Make sure you start and finish your round within the designated timeframes. Starting late or not completing a round may lead to penalties or disqualification. When teeing off, you must play from behind the designated tee markers. If you accidentally play from outside this area, you may incur a penalty. A hole is considered complete when your ball comes to rest in the hole. Always ensure your ball is correctly holed before moving on to the next tee. The teeing area is a rectangular space defined by the tee markers. You must tee your ball within this area, and you can choose any spot within the boundaries to place your ball. Learn more: Golf Tee Size: Which Tee Length is Best for You? If you accidentally move your ball at rest (except on the putting green), you may incur a penalty. Be cautious when addressing the ball or searching for it in the rough. If your ball in motion is deflected or stopped by an outside influence, such as another player or an animal, specific rules apply to determine how to proceed. Familiarize yourself with these rules to ensure fair play. You have a maximum of three minutes to search for a lost ball. If you can't find your ball within this time, it's considered lost, and you'll need to take a penalty stroke and play another ball from your previous position. Before playing a found ball, you must ensure it's yours. If you're unsure, you may lift the ball to identify it, but you must inform your fellow players of your intention and mark the ball's position before lifting it. There are specific rules for lifting and replacing a ball during play. Be sure to follow these guidelines to avoid penalties. The rules of golf apply to all levels of play, from professional tournaments to casual weekend rounds with friends. While strict adherence to the rules is crucial in competitive settings, casual golfers may choose to relax certain rules or agree on specific variations for a more enjoyable experience. It's important to note that a solid understanding of the official rules is essential for improving your skills and ensuring fair play, even during casual rounds. As you become more familiar with the rules, you'll find it easier to navigate the nuances of the game and enjoy your time on the course. Knowing the most common golf penalties and how to avoid them will save you strokes and improve your overall experience. In this section, we'll cover the penalties for a lost ball, out of bounds, unplayable lie, and water hazards. A lost ball results in a one-stroke penalty, and you must return to the spot of your previous shot and play a new ball. To avoid losing your ball, choose an appropriate club for the shot, watch the ball's flight closely, and consider using a brightly colored ball for better visibility. If your ball goes out of bounds, you'll incur a one-stroke penalty and must replay your shot from the original position. To avoid hitting out of bounds, select a conservative target, align yourself correctly, and focus on making a smooth swing. An unplayable lie allows you to take relief with a one-stroke penalty. You have three options for relief: return to your previous shot's location, drop the ball within two club lengths, or move back on a straight line from the hole. To avoid unplayable lies, choose your targets wisely and be cautious when playing from difficult lies. Hitting a ball into a water hazard results in a one-stroke penalty. You have several options for taking relief, including playing the ball as it lies (if possible), dropping a ball behind the hazard, or returning to the spot of your previous shot. To avoid water hazards, consider laying up short of the hazard, select a higher lofted club for better carry, or aim for a safer target on the green. Golf is a game of honor, and good etiquette is crucial for an enjoyable experience. In this section, we'll discuss the essential aspects of golf etiquette and sportsmanship. Always prioritize safety by waiting for the group in front to clear the area before playing your shot, yelling "Fore!" if your ball is heading toward someone, and standing a safe distance away from other players while they swing. Maintain a reasonable pace by being ready to play when it's your turn, limiting practice swings, and walking briskly between shots. Allow faster groups to play through if your group is holding up play, and respect the right of way on the course. Help maintain the course by replacing divots, repairing ball marks on the green, and raking bunkers after playing from them. Show respect by remaining quiet and still while others play, avoiding distracting movements, and offering encouragement and support.

A: You may only clean your ball when it's on the putting green or when the rules permit lifting and cleaning (e.g., when taking relief). A: Sharing clubs is not allowed. Each player must have their own set of clubs, with a maximum of 14 clubs per player. A: You cannot ground your club in a bunker before making a stroke.

September 16, 2025 / by Aimee Jackson Golf is hard, we know. It’s even harder to get into if you don’t know some of those unspoken rules and traditions that govern a round of golf. We all start somewhere, why not here with this list of more in-depth practical advice that goes beyond just what to wear on the course? (but FYI, it's best to call the course ahead of time if you have questions on attire🤔) Prepare to delve into some unexpected questions (complete with answers!) that will guide you through your first golfing journey, so you can walk the golf walk with confidence and avoid any rookie mistakes along the way! Last updated: September 2025 Quick Take: Your first round is about fun, not perfection. Here’s what to expect, how to prepare, and how to avoid common rookie mistakes. You are golf course ready if you can confidently check off all items in the list below: Here are some before you arrive at the golf course, “good to knows”: 7-Iron Distance Best Course Length 80 yards or less 3,500 - 3,700 95 4,100 - 4,300 110 4,800 - 5,000 125 5,400 - 5,600 140 5,900 - 6,100 155 6,400 - 6,600 170 or more 6,700 - 6,900 Playing from tees that match your skill level keeps the game fun and builds confidence right away. For example: according to the above table, if you hit your 7-iron 95 yards, it's recommended that you play the Green tees at Poppy Hills Golf Course since the total course length (denoted on the scorecard below) is 4,173 yards. Here are a few things to consider when scoring your round: It’s okay to pre-determine how you want to play your round. Simply inform your playing partners that this is your inaugural round, and they will be more than willing to accommodate your preferences. Just be sure that your play isn’t disruptive to their round. Some perfectly acceptable first round ideas include: Your first round isn’t about your score — it’s about learning the game, enjoying the experience, and wanting to come back. Q: Do I need to know all the rules?A: No. Focus on etiquette, safety, and pace. You’ll learn the rest.Q: What should I wear?A: Collared shirt, comfortable shoes, and bring water/sunscreen. Many courses rent clubs if you don’t own any.Q: How long will it take?A: About 2–3 hours for 9 holes, 4–5 hours for 18 (sometimes more your first time).Q: Can I post my first round for a Handicap Index?A: Yes, if it meets WHS conditions. NCGA membership gives you GHIN access to post scores.Q: What’s the #1 mistake beginners make?A: Playing from back tees. Start forward for more fun and less frustration. Just like entering a crowded gym for the first time (or returning after the New Year's rush), playing your first round of golf can feel like all eyes are on you, analyzing your every swing. However, rest assured that every golfer out there is primarily focused on their own game, not yours. Take a deep breath, enjoy the walk, and remember — every golfer started somewhere. Your first round is the beginning of a lifetime game. Hopefully this list helps ease that pre-round anxiety that only starting a new hobby like golf can trigger. Be sure to pass along these valuable insights to fellow beginners in your golfing circle to help them feel more at ease when stepping onto the course for the first time.

I think it’s been too long for r/golf to not have a good beginners guide for new golfers, and given the lower numbers of new golf players as of late, I decided to make an easy-to-use guide. I hope it helps you enjoy golf as much as I do. There are going to be a few elements in this guide that are more opinion than fact, but I believe the few opinions will be generally uncontroversial and reflect the majority opinion. If you disagree with anything in the guide, if you find a typo, have comments, or found that this guide was helpful, please feel free to comment or PM me. Thanks for reading. Ok so you’re interested in playing golf or you want to know how to improve? That’s awesome. Golf is a very rewarding game. For many of us, it doesn’t get better than spending a sunny day with friends out on the course. Plus, there’s usually beer. This guide is going to cover almost all of the information you’re going to need to effectively get up and running with golf while avoiding a lot of common mistakes. Golf terminology. There's lots of lingo you'll need to learn. Rules of Golf. There are a lot of rules in golf, many that are not so obvious. Unless you’re in a tournament or playing for money, most of them aren’t terribly important IMO. I play to have fun, but YMMV. You will want to read up on what to do with lost balls though. Check out these threads for more on rules. What to Wear. Most courses require collared shirts (polos) for men, but have eased up that requirement for women. Shorts, pants, or a skirt are just fine. I’d recommend a hat, sunglasses, and sun-tan lotion as well. There are a number of faux pas that you can commit on the golf course, so be sure to read this full list before going out. Some common mistakes include: Not repairing your pitch marks. When the ball lands on the green, it can sometimes leave an in indent which will screw up putts. If you don’t repair it properly, you can destroy the root. Watch this video to learn how to repair your pitch marks. Also fix your divots and rake sand traps. Not keeping up with the pace of play. Be ready to take your shot when it’s your turn. Talking while people are taking their shot. Or talking loud enough that people putting or teeing off on other holes can hear you. Just be considerate. Not picking up your tees. If it’s not broken, you can reuse it. If it is broken, just toss it in the garbage. If you're on a par 3, you can consider leaving the top of the tee for someone else to use. Giving unsolicited advice. I almost never give advice on the course unless I’m with a friend who I know would appreciate and use it. And when I do give it, it’s only for high-visibility, easily correctable mistakes, plus I’ll start by asking if they want advice. Giving people unsolicited advice is in poor form and you might even hurt their game by making them think too much which can throw off their swing. Hitting your ball near other people. If they could be in range, just wait. If you accidentally hit it near them, yell “Fore!” or something to warn them. Not letting people play through. If your group is slower and the group behind you has to wait a lot for you to finish, let them play the next hole first. Parking the golf cart or pull cart on the green. Greens are super sensitive and very expensive to repair so don’t risk damaging them. Standing very close to the cup. The ground around the cup is not going to be very strong so if you stand near very close to the lip of the cup, you risk damaging it. Walking or casting a shadow on people’s putting lines. Putting is hard enough as it is without other players distracting you. Standing too close to a player swinging his club. Some people apparently need to learn this lesson the hard way. Starting out, your clubs will not matter very much. You’re not going to be hitting consistently and $1,000 irons are going to be completely wasted upon you. A lot of people will start golf by just using friends’ clubs or renting them from the golf course. That way you can decide if you like it enough to invest money in your own set. If you're ready to buy, then I think your safest bet is going to be buying a used set on Craigslist or buying used clubs piecemeal. Buying a nice set of a clubs that are a few years old is a great way to get good stuff at a reasonable price. I think many would recommend not buying a new beginner’s set as they are not generally considered to be of the best quality, and when you improve, you’ll definitely want to upgrade. So long term, you’re spending more than you would otherwise. And buying new, really nice clubs is not going to be the best use of money at this point. Take the money you save by buying used and invest it in golf lessons, range time, and actual golf. That will serve you much better. Here's a post with some good info on buying clubs. After you get clubs, here are some more things you’ll need: Golf bag. Getting one that stands up automatically and has backpack straps is worth it IMO. Golf balls. For a beginner, I would just use whatever is cheapest. Buying used balls online or in the $.50 bin at your course is fine. You’re probably going to be losing a lot of balls initially, so cheaper is better IMO. I've bought balls from Craigslist for pennies on the dollar. Tees. I bought a bag of 500 a few years back for $10 which will last me practically forever. Divot Repair Tool. You’ll occasionally need this to repair greens when your ball makes a divot upon landing. Ball marker. You can use a coin, but at least have something small and flat to mark where your ball is on the green. Two towels. One for your clubs and balls, and one for your face. Anticipate getting sweaty. Golf shoes. Very optional. They definitely help when the grass is wet, but unless traction is an issue, you don’t really need them. When you do get them, make sure to get ones with plastic, not metal spikes as a lot of courses don’t allow metal spikes anymore. Golf glove. I don’t personally use one. They do provide extra grip if your hand gets very sweaty and protect your hand from getting calluses. Many gloves tend to wear out quickly, and since sweat and calluses aren't an issue for me, I don’t bother. If you do go for a glove, don't cheap out. It'll wear out sooner and you'll spend more money in the long run. There's also some good comments about gloves below this post. One of the biggest high-level problems I see is people approaching golf with unrealistic expectations. Unless you’re Kim Il Sung, you’re not gonna be shooting a perfect game of golf (18 hole in ones), nor are you going to be shooting anywhere near par every hole. It’s just not gonna happen anytime soon. Even the pros regularly hit well over par and they have tens of thousands of hours into this game while you probably have close to zero. Remember that on TV, they only show you the leaders in the tournament and then highlights from other golfers. They're only showing you the best of the best of the best. Read this article to get an idea of how unrealistic many golfers' expectations are. With putting, even the pros are missing around 5% of the time from 5 feet and their success percentage decreases exponentially from there. So many of my friends get so upset when their putt from 20 feet was off by like 6". That shot has like a 1% chance of success even for the pros so you should be stoked, not angry! This is a worthy read of an older guy who regrets not enjoying the game while he could. I am not trying to get you down, you just need to understand two things: Golf is not a game of perfect. You cannot win golf. I and many others have observed people playing golf with the idea that every shot should be perfect, and getting angry and frustrated when that doesn’t happen. I think it leads people to love/hate the game, rather than just enjoying the process even if the end result isn’t a great score. Golf is really not very fun when you’re whiffing 80%+ of your shots. I’m not talking about when the ball doesn’t go exactly where you want. I’m talking when you completely screw your swing up and hit the ball who-the-heck-knows-where, or when you top it and it goes 10 feet, or when you just completely miss the ball. That’s just not fun. But…it does get better. You’re just going to have to suffer through some of that, but once you start hitting that ball with a nice loft and distance…oh man. Feels good, brah. With this guide and conscious practice, I believe you’ll minimize the shitty period. Remember: Sucking at something is the first step to being sorta good at something. All right, let’s finally start talking about actually playing golf. Here are the basic first steps for establishing a swing. There are LOTS of videos on golf out there, so don’t feel like you only need to go by these: The Grip. The Setup & Common Mistakes at Setup. How to Swing. How to Putt. How to Chip. How to play out of a bunker. From there, the sky’s the limit both when it comes to improving your swing and the resources available for doing so. Taking a lesson from a golf pro is highly recommended. Having someone show you in-person the basics makes a big difference. Expect to pay $50-100 per hour, but private lessons can go to $500+ (You don't need a lesson from Tiger to learn the basics). I think almost all golfers would agree that an initial lesson or two is well worth the money and will offer an extremely high return on investment. It’s better to pay a little now to get good habits ingrained than pay a lot later to try to fix a bad habit. One or more of your local courses will almost assuredly offer lessons. Once you’ve got a basic swing down, you can consider having your swing analyzed online via video (there are lots of online coaches, mind you) for 25-75% cheaper or even posting it to r/golf for analysis. There are many more out there, but these guys are pretty great: Shawn Clement. Mark Crossfield. Rickard Strongert. Paul Wilson. Lifting your head too early. If you’re not watching the ball, you ain’t gonna hit it. This is without a doubt, the biggest problem beginners have. Keep watching that ball until your body naturally pulls it up. Straightening your legs. If you’re topping the ball, one of the main causes is standing up all the way which will naturally raise the club head’s path. Not aiming properly. Aiming is actually a lot harder to do intuitively than you'd think. Your feet, thighs, and shoulders should all be lined up at your target. To verify aim, get exactly set up as if you're about to hit and then hold your club across your shoulders and look where it's pointed. Adjust as needed. Even my friends who are almost scratch players check their aim occasionally so don't be afraid to as a beginner. Far better to spend a few seconds checking aim then a few minutes finding a ball in the woods! Swinging too fast/hard. Slow your swing down. Ego is the enemy in golf. I know you want to murder the ball, but your swing is not good enough to handle those speeds yet. Bring the club back slowly, pause slightly when fully rotated, and have a nice, smooth release and follow through. I can basically guarantee you that you will hit the ball farther with more accuracy and way more consistency than you will if you always try to hammer it. Consistency & Accuracy>>>>>>>Distance. Not relaxing. A proper golf swing is very fluid and smooth. If your body is tense and tight, you will not be able to get a good whipping action on the the clubhead which will reduce your distances and also hurt your aim. Try just relaxing with a nice slow swing and see how much easier and better your shots are and body feels. Thanks ChampagneFloozy. Not hitting down on the ball. This is a counter intuitive point, but go with me on this. In an optimal golf swing, the clubhead will impact the ball while it is still on its downward arc. It will be almost at the bottom, but you are in fact, not scooping the ball into the air. Here's Tiger demonstrating it. The ball gets into the air by the loft of the club, not by you lifting it off the ground. The benefits of this are increased backspin and speed from your club not being slowed down by the grass. To learn this method, try looking an inch or two ahead of the ball and/or adjusting the location of the ball in your stance so the ball is just before your divot starts. Here's a video on this.

Golf is a sport rich in tradition and history. As a result, it has many terms, rules, and regulations that can be tough to learn at first. This is why our golf experts at our South Florida Golf Course compiled a list of common golf terms, rules, etiquette, tournaments, and equipment so that you show up to the course prepared. As part of our expert’s beginner’s guide to golf, we are helping new golfers understand the different golfing terms they need to know before their first round of golf. It is important to understand and follow at least the basic rules of golf to ensure a fair game is played and that the sport is competitive for all players. Our experts at Deer Creek have put together the main rules to follow when playing golf. You can check out the official rules of golf on the USGA website. Although golf is a competitive sport, there are general guidelines and etiquette that are expected to be followed on the course. While not found in the official rule book, these guidelines are expected to be followed at all golf courses, including our Deerfield Beach, Florida course. A golf handicap is a number that represents the skill level of a golfer. A golf handicap will vary from player to player and is based on previous scores achieved. The formula for calculating your golf score can change from year to year. You can find the latest handicap calculator on the official USGA website here. In order to calculate your handicap, you will need to have golfed at least a 9 or 18-hole course and have your scorecard handy. A great way to learn more about the game of golf is to watch the professionals. Watching professional players golf can also give you pointers on your own game and set an example for yourself. The major golf tournaments are as follows: Our Deer Creek Golf Course is open to the public, and to any and all golfers, from beginners to professionals. There are no handicap requirements to playing, and we only ask that you respect the golf etiquette outlined above. Check out our tee times and rates for our renowned course.

Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically have either 9 or 18 holes, regions of terrain that each contain a cup, the hole that receives the ball. Each hole on a course has a teeing ground for the hole's first stroke, and a putting green containing the cup. There are several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall grass), and various hazards that may be water, rocks, or sand-filled bunkers. Each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout. Many golf courses are designed to resemble their native landscape, such as along a sea coast (where the course is called a links), within a forest, among rolling hills, or part of a desert. Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, especially at the elite level. The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest golf tournament, is The Open Championship, also known as The Open, which was first played in 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship. While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated. Some historians[3] trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game.[4] Others cite chuiwan (捶丸; "chui" means striking and "wan" means small ball)[5] as the progenitor, a Chinese game played between the eighth and fourteenth centuries.[6] A Ming Dynasty scroll by the artist Youqiu dating back to 1368 entitled "The Autumn Banquet" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole.[5] The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages.[7] Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France.[7] The Persian game chowkan is another possible ancient origin, albeit being more polo-like. In addition, kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V, a year earlier. The modern game originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery.[8] James IV lifted the ban in 1502 when he became a golfer himself, with golf clubs first recorded in 1503–1504: "For golf clubbes and balles to the King that he playit with".[9] To many golfers, the Old Course at St Andrews, a links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage.[10] In 1764, the standard 18-hole golf course was created at St Andrews when members modified the course from 22 to 18 holes.[11] Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links, East Lothian, Scotland as early as 2 March 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records.[12][13] The oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which was played at Leith, Scotland.[14] The world's oldest golf tournament in existence, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland, with Scottish golfers winning the earliest majors.[15] Two Scotsmen from Dunfermline, John Reid and Robert Lockhart, first demonstrated golf in the U.S. by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888, with Reid setting up America's first golf club the same year, Saint Andrew's Golf Club in Yonkers, New York.[16] A golf course consists of either 9 or 18 holes, each with a teeing ground or "tee box" that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area, fairway, rough and other hazards, and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin (normally a flagstick) and cup. The levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty, or to allow for putting in the case of the green. While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing area to the green, some holes may bend either to the left or to the right. This is commonly called a "dogleg", in reference to a dog's knee. The hole is called a "dogleg left" if the hole angles leftwards and "dogleg right" if it bends right. Sometimes, a hole's direction may bend twice; this is called a "double dogleg". A regular golf course consists of 18 holes, but nine-hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes.[17][18] Early Scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land, soil-covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches. The word "links" derives from the Scots language and the Old English word hlinc ("rising ground, ridge"): traditionally these are coastal sand dunes but sometimes open parkland.[19] This gave rise to the term "golf links", particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland.[20] The first 18-hole golf course in the United States was on a sheep farm in Downers Grove, Illinois, in 1892. The course is still there today.[21] Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A "round" typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes. The game can be played by any number of people, although a typical group will have 1–4 people playing the round. The typical amount of time required for pace of play is about two hours for a 9-hole round and four hours for an 18-hole round.[22] Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. A tee is a small peg that can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were provided for the purpose.[23][24] A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground. Tees help reduce the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit by elevating the ball from the playing surface.[25] When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance, typically more than 225 yards (210 m), the shot is commonly called a "drive" and is generally made with a long-shafted, large-headed wood club called a "driver".[26] Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs, such as higher-numbered woods or irons. Once the ball comes to rest, the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a "lay-up", an "approach", a "pitch", or a "chip", until the ball reaches the green, where the golfer then "putts" the ball into the hole (commonly called "sinking the putt" or "holing out"). The goal of getting the ball into the hole ("holing" the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called "rough" (usually found alongside fairways), which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; "doglegs", which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them; bunkers (or sand traps); and water hazards such as ponds or streams.[17] In stroke play competitions, each player must play their ball until it is holed, recording the number of strokes made.[27] Conversely in match play, once a player has equaled the number of strokes their opponents took to complete the hole, it is acceptable for them to concede the hole and pick up their ball.[28] It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the "par" rating of the hole (a "triple bogey" – see below); while technically a violation of Rule 3–2, this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others, and avoids "runaway scores" and excessive frustration.[29] Alternatively, in competition, the committee may designate a maximum score possible for a hole for the same reasons, while formalizing the surrender or "pick-up" rule.[30] The total distance from the first teeing ground to the 18th green can be quite long; total yardages "through the green" can be in excess of 7,000 yards (6,400 m), and when adding in the travel distance between the green of one hole and the tee of the next, even skilled players may easily travel 5 miles (8.0 km) or more during a round. At some courses, gas or electric golf carts are used to travel between shots, which can speed-up play and allows participation by individuals unable to walk a whole round. On other courses players generally walk the course, either carrying their bag using a shoulder strap or using a "golf trolley" for their bag. These trolleys may or may not be battery assisted. At many amateur tournaments including U.S. high school and college play, players are required to walk and to carry their own bags, but at the professional and top amateur level, as well as at high-level private clubs, players may be accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course.[31] The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA).[32][33] With the aim of simplifying the rules, in 2017 the USGA and R&A undertook a complete rewrite.[34] The new rule book came into effect in January 2019.[35] The underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book: There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers.[36] Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status. In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course. Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience. Penalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Either one or two strokes are added for most rule infractions or for taking relief from various situations, with the "general penalty" defined as two-strokes, and disqualification for severe or repeated rule breaches. Examples include: Golf clubs are used to hit a golf ball. Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance (or "grip") on the top end and a club head on the bottom. Long clubs, which have a lower degree of loft, are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance, and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance. The actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter, depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball. Golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types. Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively "open" lies, such as the teeing ground and fairway. Of particular importance is the driver or "1-wood", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to 300 yards (270 m), or more, in a professional golfer's hands. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature. A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round. The choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion, although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules. (Clubs that meet these parameters are usually called "conforming".) Violation of these rules can result in disqualification. The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course, and which club is used to accomplish the shot, are always completely at the discretion of the golfer; in other words, there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot. Golf balls are spherical, usually white (although other colours are allowed), and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion, which delays "boundary layer" separation and reduces the drag-inducing "wake" behind the ball, thereby allowing the ball to fly farther.[38] The combination of a soft "boundary layer" and a hard "core" enables both distance and spin. A tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay their first shot from the tee. Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots. A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play. Golf bags usually have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, others may be carried over both shoulders like a backpack, and often bags have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest. The golf swing is outwardly similar to many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat. However, unlike many of these motions, the result of the swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed. These ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path; that the clubface is in line with the swing path; and that the ball hits the centre or "sweet spot" of the clubface. The ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs with a wide range of shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve. Stance refers to how the golfer positions themselves in order to play a stroke; it is fundamentally important in being able to play a stroke effectively. The stance adopted is determined by what stroke is being played. All stances involve a slight crouch. This allows for a more efficient striking posture whilst also isometrically preloading the muscles of the legs and core; this allows the stroke to be played more dynamically and with a greater level of overall control. When adopting their stance golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target (for a right-hander, the target is to their left). Setting the stance in regard to the position of the ball, and placing the clubhead behind the ball, is known as being at address; when in this position the player's body and the centerline of the club face are positioned parallel to the desired line of travel, with the feet either perpendicular to that line or slightly splayed outward. The feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters, narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods. The ball is typically positioned more to the "front" of the player's stance (closer to the leading foot) for lower-lofted clubs, with the usual ball position for a drive being just behind the arch of the leading foot. The ball is placed further "back" in the player's stance (toward the trailing foot) as the loft of the club to be used increases. Most iron shots and putts are made with the ball roughly centered in the stance, while a few mid- and short-iron shots are made with the ball slightly behind the centre of the stance to ensure consistent contact between the ball and clubface, so the ball is on its way before the club continues down into the turf. The golfer chooses a golf club, grip, and stroke appropriate to the distance: Having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance, the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single "plane" of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction. Accuracy and consistency are typically stressed over pure distance. A player with a straight drive that travels only 220 yards (200 m) will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favourable lie on the fairway, and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using "more club" (a lower loft) on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots. However, a golfer with a drive that may go 280 yards (260 m) but often does not fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously; the ball may "hook", "pull", "draw", "fade", "push" or "slice" off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards, and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out. A golf stroke uses the muscles of the core (especially erector spinae muscles and latissimus dorsi muscle when turning), hamstring, shoulder, and wrist. Stronger muscles in the wrist can prevent them from being twisted during swings, whilst stronger shoulders increase the turning force. Weak wrists can also transmit the force to elbows and even neck and lead to injury. (When a muscle contracts, it pulls equally from both ends and, to have movement at only one end of the muscle, other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which the other end of the muscle is attached.) Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles.[39][40] Putting is considered to be the most important component of the game of golf. As the game of golf has evolved, there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts. When the game originated, golfers would putt with their dominant hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak hand on top of the grip. This grip and putting style is known as "conventional". There are many variations of conventional including overlap, where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky; interlock, where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger; double or triple overlap and so on.[41] Recently, "cross handed" putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs. Cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom. This grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke.[42] Other notable putting styles include "the claw", a style that has the grip directly in between the thumb and index finger of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target.[43] The weak hand placed normally on the putter. Anchored putting, a style that requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the player's stomach or below the chin; the idea is to stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke. This style has been banned on professional circuits since 2016.[44] A hole is classified by its par, which gives an indication of the number of strokes a skilled golfer may be expected to need to complete play of the hole.[17] The primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight, hazard-free hole is the distance from the tee to the green, and calculates the number of strokes a skilled golfer is expected to require to reach the green with an additional allowance of 2 putts. As such, the minimum par of any hole is 3; one stroke for the tee shot and two putts. Par 3, 4 and 5 holes are commonplace on golf courses; far more rarely, courses may feature par-6 and even par-7 holes. For men, a typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (230 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251–450 yards (230–411 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 450 yards (410 m); for women these boundaries are lower, and for professionals they are much increased. The rare par-6s can stretch well over 650 yards (590 m). These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between 240 and 280 yards (220 and 260 m). Although length is the primary factor in calculating par, other factors are taken into account; however the number of strokes a scratch golfer should take to make the green remains foremost. Factors affecting the calculation include altitude, gradient of the land from the tee to green, and forced "lay-ups" due to dog-legs (sharp bends) or obstacles (e.g. bunkers, water hazards).[45] Getting the ball onto the green in two strokes less than par, and hence meeting the par calculation criteria, is called making "green in regulation" or GIR.[46] Missing a GIR does not necessarily mean a golfer will not make par, but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available; conversely, making a GIR does not guarantee a par, as the player might require three or more putts to "hole out". Professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation.[47] Eighteen-hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 70 to 72 for a complete round; with most holes having a par of 4, and a smaller number of par-3 and par-5 holes. Additionally, courses may be classified according to their play difficulty, which may be used to calculate a golfer's handicap.[48] The two primary difficulty ratings in the U.S. are the Course Rating, which is the expected score for a zero-handicap "scratch golfer", and the Slope Rating, which is a measure of how much worse a "bogey golfer" (handicap around 20) would be expected to play than a "scratch golfer" relative to their handicap. The goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible. A golfer's number of strokes in a hole, course, or tournament is compared to its respective par score, and is then reported either as the number that the golfer was "under-" or "over-par", or if it was "equal to par". A hole in one (or an "ace") occurs when a golfer sinks their ball into the cup with their first stroke from the tee. Common scores for a hole also have specific terms.[17] In a typical professional tournament or among "scratch" amateur players, "birdie-bogey" play is common; a player will "lose" a stroke by bogeying a hole, then "gain" one by scoring a birdie. Eagles are uncommon but not rare; however, only 18 players have scored an albatross in a men's major championship. One of the rarest feats in golf is the condor, which has never occurred in a professional tournament. Only five condors have been verified to have ever occurred, although none of the courses involved were professionally accredited.[49] There are two basic forms of golf play, match play and stroke play. Stroke play is more popular. Two players (or two teams) play each hole as a separate contest against each other in what is called match play. The party with the lower score wins that hole, or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is "halved" (or tied). The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other. In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played, the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead, and the remainder of the holes are not played. For example, if one party already has a lead of six holes, and only five holes remain to be played on the course, the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won "6 & 5". At any given point, if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining, the party leading the match is said to be "dormie", and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes, thereby winning the match, or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player's opponent winning all remaining holes. When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played, it may be continued until one side takes a one-hole lead.[17] The score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of their opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament. There are many variations in scoring and playing formats in the game of golf, some officially defined in the Rules of Golf. Variations include the popular Stableford scoring system, and various team formats. Some common and popular examples are listed below. There are also variations on the usual starting procedure where everyone begins from the first tee and plays all holes in order, through to the eighteenth. In large field tournaments, especially on professional tours, a two tee start is commonplace, where the field will be split between starting on the first tee and the tenth tee (sometimes the eighth or eleventh depending on proximity to the clubhouse). Shotgun starts are mainly used for amateur tournament or society play. In this variant, each of the groups playing starts their game on a different hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round at roughly the same time. For example, a group starting on hole 5 will play through to the 18th hole and continue with hole 1, ending their round on hole 4. A bogey or par competition is a scoring format sometimes seen in informal tournaments. Its scoring is similar to match play, except each player compares their hole score to the hole's par rating instead of the score of another player. The player "wins" the hole if they score a birdie or better, they "lose" the hole if they score a bogey or worse, and they "halve" the hole by scoring par. By recording only this simple win–loss–halve score on the sheet, a player can shrug off a very poorly-played hole with a simple "-" mark and move on. As used in competitions, the player or pair with the best win–loss differential wins the competition. The Stableford system is a simplification of stroke play that awards players points based on their score relative to the hole's par; the score for a hole is calculated by taking the par score, adding 2, then subtracting the player's hole score, making the result zero if negative. Alternately stated, a double bogey or worse is zero points, a bogey is worth one point, par is two, a birdie three, an eagle four, and so on. The advantages of this system over stroke play are a more natural "higher is better" scoring, the ability to compare Stableford scores between plays on courses with different total par scores (scoring an "even" in stroke play will always give a Stableford score of 36), discouraging the tendency to abandon the entire game after playing a particularly bad hole (a novice playing by strict rules may score as high as an 8 or 10 on a single difficult hole; their Stableford score for the hole would be zero, which puts them only two points behind par no matter how badly they played), and the ability to simply pick up one's ball once it is impossible to score any points for the hole, which speeds play. The USGA and R&A sanction a "Modified Stableford" system for scratch players, which makes par worth zero, a birdie worth 2, eagle 5 and double-eagle 8, while a bogey is a penalty of −1 and a double-bogey or worse −3. As with the original system, the highest score wins the game, and terrible scores on one or two holes will not ruin a player's overall score, but this system rewards "bogey-birdie" play more than the original, encouraging golfers to try to make riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshots instead of simply parring each hole.[17] A handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer's potential scoring ability over 18 holes. It is used to enable players of widely varying abilities to compete against one another. Better players are those with the lowest handicaps, and someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often referred to as a scratch golfer. Handicap systems vary throughout the world and use different methods to assess courses and calculate handicaps. In order to address difficulties in translating between these systems the USGA and The R&A, working with the various existing handicapping authorities, devised a new World Handicap System which was introduced globally starting in 2020.[55] Golf courses are assessed and rated according to the average good score of a scratch golfer, taking into account a multitude of factors affecting play, such as length, obstacles, undulations, etc. A player's handicap gives an indication of the number of strokes above this course rating that the player will make over the course of an "average best" round of golf, i.e. scoring near their potential, above average.[56] Lower handicap players are generally the most consistent, so can be expected to play to this standard or better more often than higher handicappers. Some handicap systems also account for differences in scoring difficulty between low and high handicap golfer. They do this by means of assessing and rating courses according to the average good score of a "bogey golfer", a player with a handicap of around 20. This is used with the course rating to calculate a slope rating, which is used to adjust golfer's handicap to produce a playing handicap for the course and set of tees being used.[57] Handicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap (sandbagging) before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize. For this reason, handicaps are not used in professional golf, but they can still be calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players. Touring professionals, being the best of the best, have negative handicaps; they can be expected, more often than not, to score lower than the Course Rating on any course. In 2005, Golf Digest calculated that the countries with the most golf courses per capita, in order, were: Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, Ireland, Canada, Wales, the United States, Sweden, and England (countries with fewer than 500,000 people were excluded). The number of courses in other territories has increased, an example of this being the expansion of golf in China. The first golf course in China opened in 1984, but by the end of 2009, there were roughly 600 golf courses in China. For much of the 21st century, the development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned (with the exception of the island province of Hainan), but the number of courses had nonetheless tripled from 2004 to 2009; the "ban" has been evaded with the government's tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans.[58] In the United States, women made up 25 percent of golfers in 2021, which was up from 19 percent since 2011 and junior female golfers account for 35 percent or 1.1 million golfers.[59] In the United States, the number of people who play golf twenty-five times or more per year decreased from 6.9 million in 2000 to 4.6 million in 2005,[60] according to the National Golf Foundation. The NGF reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 26 million over the same period.[60] In February 1971, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first person to golf anywhere other than on Earth. He smuggled a golf club head and two golf balls on board Apollo 14 in order to play golf on the Moon. He attached the head to a tool for collecting rock samples, and attempted two drives. He shanked the first attempt, but it is estimated his second went 40 yards (37 m).[61] As of 2019, the United States has the highest number of golf courses—as much as 43% of the total—and combined with second placed Japan together account for a majority (51%) of golf courses worldwide. Below is a table stating the number of golf courses in countries:[62] The majority of professional golfers work as club or teaching professionals ("pros"), and only compete in local competitions. A small elite of professional golfers are "tournament pros" who compete full-time on international "tours". Many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as caddies or with a general interest in the game, finding employment at golf courses and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession. These programs include independent institutions and universities, and those that eventually lead to a Class A golf professional certification. Touring professionals typically start as amateur players, who attain their "pro" status after success in major tournaments that win them either prize money and/or notice from corporate sponsors. Jack Nicklaus, for example, gained widespread notice by finishing second in the 1960 U.S. Open to champion Arnold Palmer, with a 72-hole score of 282 (the best score to date in that tournament by an amateur). He played one more amateur year in 1961, winning that year's U.S. Amateur, before turning pro in 1962. Golf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf. Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. In some countries, golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association. Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, on-course play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course. There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a Professional Golfers Association or an independent tour organization, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. Typically a tour has "members" who are entitled to compete in most of its events, and also invites non-members to compete in some of them. Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive, and most professional golfers never achieve it. Perhaps the most widely known tour is the PGA Tour, which tends to attract the strongest fields, outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events. This is due mostly to the fact that most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least 800,000 USD. The European Tour, which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside North America, ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige. Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour. Since 2010, both tours' money titles have been claimed by the same individual three times, with Luke Donald doing so in 2011 and Rory McIlroy in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, Henrik Stenson won the FedEx Cup points race on the PGA Tour and the European Tour money title, but did not top the PGA Tour money list (that honour going to Tiger Woods). The other leading men's tours include the Japan Golf Tour, the Asian Tour (Asia outside Japan), the PGA Tour of Australasia, and the Sunshine Tour (based in southern Africa, primarily South Africa). The Japan, Australasian, Sunshine, PGA, and European Tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world's main tours, the International Federation of PGA Tours, founded in 1996. The Asian Tour became a full member in 1999. The Canadian Tour became an associate member of the Federation in 2000, and the Tour de las Américas (Latin America) became an associate member of the Federation in 2007. The Federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 that saw eleven new tours become full members – the Canadian Tour, Tour de las Américas, China Golf Association, the Korea Professional Golfers' Association, Professional Golf Tour of India, and the operators of all six major women's tours worldwide. In 2011, the Tour de las Américas was effectively taken over by the PGA Tour, and in 2012 was folded into the new PGA Tour Latinoamérica. Also in 2012, the Canadian Tour was renamed PGA Tour Canada after it agreed to be taken over by the PGA Tour. All men's tours that are Federation members, except the India tour, offer points in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) to players who place sufficiently high in their events. Golf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players. There are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over, arguably the best known of which is the U.S.-based PGA Tour Champions. There are six principal tours for women, each based in a different country or continent. The most prestigious of these is the United States–based LPGA Tour. All of the principal tours offer points in the Women's World Golf Rankings for high finishers in their events. All of the leading professional tours for under-50 players have an official developmental tour, in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season. Examples include the Korn Ferry Tour, which feeds to the PGA Tour, and the Challenge Tour, which is the developmental tour of the European Tour. The Korn Ferry and Challenge Tours also offer OWGR points. The major championships are the four most prestigious men's tournaments of the year. In chronological order they are: The Masters, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open, and The Open Championship (referred to in North America as the British Open).[64] The fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world. The Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, since its inception in 1934. It is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year.[65] The U.S. Open and PGA Championship are played at courses around the United States, while the Open Championship is played at courses around the United Kingdom.[66] Prior to the advent of the PGA Championship and The Masters, the four Majors were the U.S. Open, the U.S. Amateur, the Open Championship, and the British Amateur. Women's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of majors recognised by the dominant women's tour, the LPGA Tour in the U.S., has changed several times over the years, with the most recent changes occurring in 2001 and 2013. Like the PGA Tour, the (U.S.) LPGA[67] tour long had four majors, but now has five: the Chevron Championship (previously known by several other names, most recently the ANA Inspiration), the Women's PGA Championship (previously known as the LPGA Championship),[68] the U.S. Women's Open, the Women's British Open (which replaced the du Maurier Classic as a major in 2001) and The Evian Championship (added as the fifth major in 2013). Only the last two are also recognised as majors by the Ladies European Tour. However, the significance of this is limited, as the LPGA is far more dominant in women's golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men's golf. For example, the BBC has been known to use the U.S. definition of "women's majors" without qualifying it. Also, the Ladies' Golf Union, the governing body for women's golf in Great Britain and Ireland, stated on its official website that the Women's British Open was "the only Women's Major to be played outside the U.S."[69] (this was before the elevation of The Evian Championship to major status). For many years, the Ladies European Tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the LPGA Tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three LPGA majors played in the U.S., but that changed beginning in 2008, when the LET scheduled an event opposite the LPGA Championship. The second-richest women's tour, the LPGA of Japan Tour, does not recognise any of the U.S. LPGA or European majors as it has its own set of majors (historically three, since 2008 four). However, these events attract little notice outside Japan. Senior (aged fifty and over) men's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of senior majors on the U.S.-based PGA Tour Champions has changed over the years, but always by expansion. PGA Tour Champions now recognises five majors: the Senior PGA Championship, The Tradition, the Senior Players Championship, the United States Senior Open, and The Senior (British) Open Championship. Of the five events, the Senior PGA is by far the oldest, having been founded in 1937. The other events all date from the 1980s, when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, reached the relevant age. The Senior Open Championship was not recognised as a major by PGA Tour Champions until 2003. The European Senior Tour recognises only the Senior PGA and the two Senior Opens as majors. However, PGA Tour Champions is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the U.S. LPGA is in global women's golf. Golf was featured in the Summer Olympic Games official programme in 1900 and 1904. After a 112-year absence, golf returned for the 2016 Rio Games.[70] The International Golf Federation (IGF) is recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the world governing body for golf. It was not until 1552 that the first woman golfer played the game. Mary Queen of Scots commissioned St. Andrew's Links.[71] However, it was not until the 20th century that women were taken seriously and eventually broke the "Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden" rule. Many men saw women as unfit to play the sport due to their supposed lack of strength and ability. In 1891, the newly built Shinnecock Hills nine-hole course in Southampton, New York became the first club to offer membership to women golfers. Four years later, in 1895, The U.S. Golf Association held the first Women's Amateur Championship tournament.[71][72] Just like professional golfer Bobby Jones, Joyce Wethered was considered to be a star in the 1920s.[73] Jones praised Wethered in 1930 after they had played an exhibition against each other. He doubted that there had ever been a better golfer, man or woman.[74] However, Bobby Jones' comment was not enough for others to change their views on women golfers. The Royal Liverpool's club refused entry of Sir Henry Cotton's wife into the clubhouse in the late 1940s. The secretary of the club released a statement saying, "No woman ever has entered the clubhouse and, praise God, no woman ever will."[73] However, American golfer and all-around athlete Babe Zaharias did not have to enter the clubhouse. She was able to prove herself on the course, going on to become the first American to win the British Women's Amateur title in 1947. The following year she became the first woman to attempt to qualify for the U.S. Open, but her application was rejected by the USGA. They stated that the event was intended to be open to men only.[75] The Ladies Professional Golf Association was formed in 1950 as a way to popularize the sport and provide competitive opportunities for golfers.[73] The competitions were not the same for the men and women. It was not until 1972 that U.S. Congress passed the Title IX of the Education Amendments. "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activities receiving Federal financial assistance."[76] American Renee Powell moved to the UK in the 1970s to further her career, and became the first woman to play in a British men's tournament in 1977.[77] As of 2016,[needs update] women golfers were still fighting to have the same opportunities as male golfers. There is still a significant pay gap in the USGA. The USGA has a long history of awarding more prize money to winners of the men's U.S. Open, than the U.S. Women's Open.[78] Golf has been adapted and simulated in video games. Nintendo's Golf (1984) is recognized as the best-selling golf video game in history.[79] Other popular golf games include Access Software's Leader Board and Links series, EA Sports's PGA Tour series, and Sony Interactive Entertainment's Everybody's Golf (aka Hot Shots Golf).[80][81]



Golf is a game of skill, strategy, and sportsmanship. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, adhering to proper golf etiquette is essential for an enjoyable and respectful experience for everyone on the course. In this post, we’ll explore 10 fundamental golf course etiquette rules, providing beginners with a solid foundation to build upon. Let’s dive into the world of golf etiquette! One of the core principles of golf etiquette is maintaining silence while others are taking their shots. Keep your conversations hushed and avoid any distracting noises. This respect for the “quiet zone” allows players to concentrate and make accurate shots. When someone is ready to take their shot, ensure you are not in their line of sight. Stand to the ball side of the golfer, maintaining a safe distance. This basic golf etiquette practice prevents distractions and enhances safety. After landing on the green, repair any ball marks or divots you create. This simple act of golf course etiquette can be done by using a ball mark repair tool to gently restore the putting surface. Repairing ball marks is a sign of respect for the course and future golfers. Maintaining a reasonable pace of play is crucial to prevent backup on the course. Play efficiently, be ready for your turn, and keep up with the group ahead. Slow play can lead to frustration for fellow golfers and is one of the most important (if not the most important) pieces of golf etiquette to make sure you adhere to. Basic golf etiquette: If you find yourself in a bunker, use the provided rake to smooth out your footprints and any disturbances in the sand. Leaving bunkers in good condition ensures fairness for all players. If your group is slower than those behind you, allow faster groups to play through. Simply step aside and let them continue, maintaining the flow of the game and reducing frustration. This simple rule of golf etiquette will keep all players on the course happy. Avoid delays by being ready when it’s your turn to play. Select your club, assess the distance, and take your shot efficiently. Remember that keeping the game moving is a key part of golf etiquette. Many golf courses are home to various forms of wildlife. Show respect for the environment by not disturbing animals, and keep your distance. This is an important aspect of golf course etiquette, and your personal safety. When removing or replacing the flagstick from the hole, do so gently to prevent damaging the green. Avoid letting the flagstick drop into the hole or on the green. Respect the course’s dress code by wearing appropriate golf attire. While dress codes may vary, generally collared shirts, proper golf shoes, and tailored shorts or slacks are acceptable. Adhering to the dress code shows respect for the course and its traditions, and golf etiquette. By following these 10 essential golf etiquette rules, beginners can enjoy a smoother and more enjoyable experience on the golf course. Remember, golf etiquette isn’t just about following rules; it’s about showing respect for the game, the course, and your fellow golfers. So, as you embark on your golfing journey, practice these basic golf etiquette principles to ensure a positive experience for everyone on the course. Happy golfing! Found This Article Helpful?

Written by Seven Bridges Looking for the perfect place to practice your game? Enjoy a welcoming course that’s great for beginners and seasoned golfers alike. Golf is a great hobby and a fantastic excuse to get outside and breathe some fresh air once in a while. However, there is a common perception of golf being an uptight and inaccessible activity. Because of that, a lot of people get frightened away and don’t ever try it for themselves out of fear that they don’t know the golf etiquette for beginners, and don’t know who to ask about it. Basically, they just don’t want to cause a fuss. This is very unfortunate because so many of those people would love it if they gave it a chance. And the fact that they’re worried about others is exactly why they’d be great people to have on a course. So, we’re writing this article for those people, and for you. We’re here to tell you that there’s really not much to worry about, and most of your fears are only based on misunderstandings and misconceptions. As long as you have a positive attitude and you follow these tips on golf etiquette for beginners, you’ll have a great time. And maybe you’ll even become a lifelong golfer yourself. You’re new, and that’s ok. Everyone has a first time, and everyone’s new for a while. That’s how it works. But for some people, it’s been a long time since they were new. And they might also be rushing to try to get a game in before a meeting or some other commitment they have. So, it’s always appreciated if you are considerate of them by… This is a way to get an edge on the competition, but, more importantly, it’s a way to show respect for everyone else’s time. If you arrive early and get your warmup in before the official start time for your game, you won’t need to do it after everyone has already arrived. Better still, you’ll be more relaxed and limbered up by the time they get there. It’s ok. You’re on the golf course to relax, and you’re probably not in a rush. There’s no point in arguing over who has the right of way or forcing people who are clearly plowing through the course faster than you to wait behind you on every hole. Take things easy and just invite them to quickly play through the hole that you’re on so that they’ll be ahead of you from then on, and it won’t be an issue. Of all the things on this list, this is one of the most important fundamentals of golf etiquette for beginners. And following it will ensure that you have no problems with anyone who is behind you. Once again, you’re here to have fun and relax. And hopefully you’re not playing for high stakes like money or anything. While we wouldn’t recommend gambling anyway, we especially wouldn’t recommend it while you’re still new and unskilled. But yeah, don’t feel like you have to be a professional and get everything right. Just relax and swing. 🏌️ A lot of people forget this, but it’s very helpful for you and everyone else playing to mark your ball with a marker or identify it in some other way. It’s also courteous to inform everyone what type of balls you’re using. This not only makes it easier to identify each person’s ball, but it also shows good faith because not all balls are created equal. Some aren’t even tournament legal. Looking for the perfect place to practice your game? Enjoy a welcoming course that’s great for beginners and seasoned golfers alike. This is both essential to golf etiquette for beginners and also a safety rule. Just like when you’re trying to hit the ball, other players don’t want to have anyone standing too close to them or have their vision obstructed in any way while they’re hitting. Keeping your distance from the person who is hitting also protects you from accidentally getting whacked with a golf club. This one generally requires that you have a ball divot repair tool. These are relatively cheap, and you can buy one online. But be sure not to cheap out and buy some flimsy made-in-China thing that’s going to break within the first ten uses. Buy a quality one from a good brand and learn how to use it properly by reading the instructions and maybe watching a tutorial or two on YouTube. This is easy enough to do, and can be as relaxing as raking the sand in a zen garden. Like everything else in golf, it can be a relaxing ritual. In fact, most aspects of golf seem to have been designed to be relaxing rituals. If you’ve been paying attention, you may be noticing that the primary root of golf etiquette for beginners is to show consideration for whoever is behind you. Another straightforward way to do this is by putting the flag sticks back into the holes before you move on to the next hole. This requires almost no effort on your part, but it makes someone else’s experience on the course better. One of the main reasons people play golf is to get out into nature (or at least a manicured version of it) and relax with a low-intensity game. That’s probably a big part of why you’re out there, too. So be part of making that atmosphere soothing by being mindful of your volume. Don’t yell, cheer, or talk too loudly. And if you want to celebrate or congratulate someone (good sportsmanship is always great), learn to master the subtle art of the golf clap. As we said at the beginning of this article, golf is a fantastic sport. It can be enjoyed by people of all ages and even people who are not physically able to compete in other, more aggressive sports. So while you’re new now, you could easily still be playing regularly for the rest of your life. You can even teach your kids and grandkids, so you can always have a shared activity to bond with the whole family over. And as long as you follow these rules of golf etiquette for beginners, you’ll have a wonderful time and be a joy to everyone else around you.

Relaxing and fun, yet challenging in mind and body, there’s a lot to love about a good game of golf. Not only is a day out on the green an excellent way of staying active while enjoying the great outdoors, it also offers a wonderful opportunity to socialise with like-minded people in your community. Golf is a highly accessible sport which can be enjoyed by people of all ages, genders, skills, and fitness levels. All you need is a couple of pieces of equipment and a booking at your local golf course. If this is your very first time, you may be feeling a little nervous. But don’t worry, our beginners guide to golf is here to introduce you to all the basic golf rules, skills, and equipment you’ll need to get started. The aim of golf is fairly straightforward: get the ball in the hole in as few shots as possible. Each hole of golf begins at the ‘teeing ground’, a prepared area where the ball is first struck. Unlike most ball games, the playing area and terrain will vary from course to course, adding an extra layer of challenge. Players strike the ball with a club, aiming for a second prepared area known as a ‘putting green’, where the hole awaits to receive the ball. Between the teeing ground and the putting green are a variety of terrains, including fairways, rough (long grass), and a range of hazards which can include rocks, water, or sand-filled pits known as ‘bunkers’. A standard round of golf typically comprises 18 holes, though 9-hole rounds are ideal for beginners. There are two main forms of play: With 24 official golf rules, each with their own sub-sections, golf can feel a little daunting for beginners. The good news is, you’re not expected to know everything straight away, though it’s best to familiarise yourself with the basic rules to help speed up play and ensure an enjoyable experience. Here are the most important golf rules to know before the game: A golf handicap is a numerical rating given to a player to gauge their approximate ability. This helps level the playing field, enabling players of all skill levels to play together. The handicap works by allowing less skilled players to deduct strokes from their overall score whilst more experienced players cannot. Every hole on the golf course has a ‘par’; the ideal number of strokes it should take to get the ball in the hole. The handicap rating indicates how many strokes ‘over par’ you’re likely to shoot in a round of golf. The lower the handicap number, the better the player. For example, on a course with a par of 72, a golfer with a handicap of 20 would be expected to complete the course in roughly 92 strokes, while a golfer with a handicap of 8 would typically complete it in 80 strokes. As a beginner, you’ll start with the maximum handicap of 54. Now that you know the basic rules of golf, it’s time to start learning how to play it. Here are some golf tips for beginners learning to play. The best place to start your golfing journey is at the driving range. Here, you can typically hire equipment and have a go without having to buy your own clubs and balls. The driving range is a comfortable and pressure-free environment where you can get a feel for your clubs, practise your golf swings, and perfect your technique before heading out to the golf course. Now that you’re a little more familiar with the basics, such as how to grip your clubs, hitting the ball, and the appropriate golfing posture, it’s time to try out your new skills on the golf course. We recommend starting with a shorter, 9-hole course, as it’s quicker and a lot less daunting than a full 18-hole course (which can take many hours to complete). Whacking the ball as hard as you can may be satisfying, but in golf, the short game is king. Once you’re on the green, the only thing that matters is sinking your putt in as few shots as possible – something you’ll struggle with if you’ve spent all your time hitting drives. Be sure to spend plenty of time strengthening your short game, practising shots such as putting, chipping, and pitching. To be the best, you’ve got to learn from the best. It’s much easier to learn good habits than to unlearn bad ones. A trained professional can teach you the basics of the game and help you perfect your technique – laying the foundations for a lifelong love of golf. Book your golf lessons today to get started. Golfing beginners don’t need a full set of 14 golf clubs to get started. In fact, you’re much better off investing in a few high-quality clubs rather than purchasing a cheaper, low-quality set. Here’s a list of the best golf clubs for beginners to start off with: As a general rule, golf balls with more layers are better suited to advanced players. As you become more experienced, you’ll be able to select a ball that better fits your game, but we recommend starting with a 2-piece golf ball to begin with. Here are the essential items you’ll need before setting out for a day of golf: At Eynesbury, we have a world-class, 18-hole golf course designed by golfing legend, Graham Marsh.

I’m not talking about pace of play, or penalties or anything like that, I’m talking about the stuff that most people won’t even correct you on because it’s not that big of a deal, but you should probably know. For example, is there a proper place to stand while someone is teeing off? Is okay to stand behind them on the tee box taking practice swings? Is it okay to drive your cart to your ball if it’s further up than someone in your group, or are you supposed to wait? What about putting? Are you supposed to stand in a particular place? Is it okay to be walking while someone is putting? Is there a correct order to tee off in or putt in, or is ready golf the way to go? The point here is that a lot of people don’t know what they don’t know, so here’s your opportunity to tell them. Create your account and connect with a world of communities.

The Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA of America) is an American organization of golf professionals that was founded in 1916. Consisting of nearly 29,000 members, the PGA of America's undertaking is to establish and elevate the standards of the profession and to grow interest and participation in the game of golf. In 1968, the PGA Tour was spun off from the PGA of America as a separate organization to administer professional golf tours. However, the PGA of America still directly conducts several tournaments, including the PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, and the Women's PGA Championship. On December 4, 2018, the PGA of America announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, to a planned 660-acre mixed-use development in Frisco, Texas. PGA Frisco is a public and private partnership between the PGA of America, Omni Hotels & Resorts, the City of Frisco and the Frisco Independent School District.[1] The 660-acre campus was inaugurated in May 2023 and it includes the headquarters of PGA America, Northern Texas PGA, Fields Ranch (two world-class 18-hole championship golf courses and a state-of-the-art clubhouse), Omni PGA Frisco Resort & Spa, and the PGA District (retail and entertainment district).[2] The Professional Golfers' Association of America was established on April 10, 1916, but the genesis of the first all-professional golf body in the United States was sparked by a luncheon on January 17, 1916, hosted by Rodman Wanamaker at Wanamaker's Store on Ninth Street and Broadway in New York City.[3] Sixty attendees were invited by the Taplow Club, which was a business group within Wanamaker's Store and led by professional Tom McNamara of Brookline, Massachusetts, an outstanding player and talented salesman who was keenly aware of the welfare of the club professional.[4] McNamara pressed upon Wanamaker that it was prime time to bring U.S. professionals together, and that the publicity generated would be advantageous. Locked into a retail battle with rival A.G. Spalding & Bros. for the sale of golf balls, Wanamaker enthusiastically approved the initiative. He asked McNamara to arrange the luncheon inviting prominent amateur and professional golf leaders from throughout the country.[5] Wanamaker's ninth floor restaurant was chosen as the site for the Monday luncheon, which attracted amateur great Francis Ouimet; noted writer, player and budding architect A.W. Tillinghast; and P.C. Pulver, the New York Evening Sun reporter and one of the first newspaper golf "beat" writers who later served as the first editor of The Professional Golfer, today's PGA Magazine. The guest list also included some of America's top professionals: Alex Smith, James Maiden, Robert White, Jack Mackie and Alex Pirie, as well as others who derived their livelihoods from their jobs at private and public golf facilities.[6] The Taplow Club was not an eatery or dining establishment. Instead, it was Wanamaker's nickname for his in-store business group. He had taken the name from a palatial estate he leased on Taplow Court some 25 miles outside London. He would later stamp "Taplow" on his store's lower-end, private-label golf balls. Wanamaker, who was not a golfer, was never reported to have attended the luncheon. He delegated the details to McNamara. With golf becoming more and more popular in the U.S., McNamara believed that his fellow professionals could benefit by working together. Wanamaker also believed consolidating professionals would also improve their social standing, having long been treated by club members as second-class citizens. Toastmaster Joseph H. Appel, vice president of Wanamaker's foundation, presented Wanamaker's offer to conduct a match play championship for professionals, similar to Great Britain's News of the World Tournament. Appel also broached the subject of a national association of professionals. In addition, Wanamaker would donate a cup and $2,580 in prize money, and would ultimately pay the travel expenses of the competitors. That "cup" became the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy, and the tournament the PGA Championship. The inaugural PGA Championship was held October 10–14, 1916, at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York, and won by English-born Jim Barnes. Former British PGA Secretary James Hepburn suggested that the 32 lowest finishers in the U.S. Open would be paired for match play, following Robert White's contention that the U.S. was too large for section qualifiers. The all-professional match play concept was in direct contrast to the United States Golf Association's medal (stroke) play format. Wanamaker requested that the proposal for the Championship be contingent upon approval by the USGA or other governing bodies. Tillinghast spoke up and declared that the professionals should be independent of the USGA in handling their own affairs and competitions. Tillinghast's argument held, as a follow-up organizational meeting was planned the following day in Wanamaker's store. Organizers then formed a seven-person group whose primary task was to define tentative bylaws for the new association. They named Hepburn to chair an organizational committee of professionals that included Maiden, White and Mackie, as well as Gilbert Nicholls, John "Jack" Hobens, and Herbert Strong—none of the group was American-born. This group drafted a constitution, turning to the British PGA for assistance. The luncheon agenda addressed giving golf professionals say when it came to the organization and staging of tournaments, among other employment issues. The response to creating such a body was positive, and additional meetings followed. On April 10, 1916, in the second-floor boardroom of the Hotel Martinique on 32nd and Broadway, the Professional Golfers' Association of America was born. There were 78 members elected that day, including 35 PGA Charter Members, of which 28 were born outside the U.S. The Association began with seven PGA Sections: Metropolitan, Middle States, New England, Southeastern, Central, Northwestern and Pacific. Today, there are 41 PGA Sections nationwide. From 1934 through November 1961, the PGA of America maintained a "Caucasian-only" membership clause in its bylaws. The clause was removed by amending its constitution.[7][8] The previous year, it had voted to retain the clause, and had gained the ire of California Attorney General Stanley Mosk, who threatened to shut down the PGA in the state until the clause was removed. The 1962 PGA Championship was scheduled for Brentwood Country Club in Los Angeles, but the PGA moved it to Philadelphia at Aronimink.[7] With an increase of revenue in the late 1960s due to expanded television coverage, a dispute arose between the touring professionals and the PGA of America on how to distribute the windfall. The tour players wanted larger purses, where the PGA desired the money to go to the general fund to help grow the game at the local level.[9] Following the final major in July 1968 at the PGA Championship, several leading tour pros voiced their dissatisfaction with the venue and the abundance of club pros in the field.[10] The increased friction resulted in a new entity in August, what would eventually become the PGA Tour.[11][12][13][14] Tournament players formed their own organization, American Professional Golfers, Inc. (APG), independent of the PGA of America.[15][16][17] After several months,[18] a compromise was reached in December: the tour players agreed to abolish the APG and form the PGA "Tournament Players Division", a fully autonomous division under the supervision of a new 10-member Tournament Policy Board.[19][20][21][22] The board consisted of four tour players, three PGA of America executives, and three outside members, initially business executives.[20][21][23] It hired its own commissioner and was renamed the "PGA Tour" in the mid-1970s. Women were not allowed to be members of the PGA until 1977.[24] In October 2014, PGA President Ted Bishop responded to Ian Poulter's criticism of the Ryder Cup captaincy of Nick Faldo and Tom Watson by calling Poulter a "lil' girl", which led to Bishop's firing. The PGA called Bishop's statements "unacceptable" and "insensitive gender-based".[25][26] The PGA conducts annual men's, senior, and women's major championships: the PGA Championship, the Senior PGA Championship, and the Women's PGA Championship (which was renamed from the LPGA Championship in 2015 after a partnership between the LPGA and the PGA of America to heighten the event's profile).[27] All three tournaments feature professional golfers, but their fields also contain slots reserved for club professionals. The PGA conducts more than 30 tournaments for its members and apprentices, including the PGA Professional Championship and the Assistant PGA Professional Championship. It also co-organizes the biennial Ryder Cup, PGA Cup and in 2019, the inaugural Women's PGA Cup. In 2003, the PGA of America created the Player Development department within the Association in an endeavor to reach out to new, past and sporadic adult golfers. This is accomplished through the growth, promotion and support of instructional programs and events at PGA Member facilities that support adults and families to play golf. Included in these programs is Play Golf America, instigated in 2004 with the help of the Allied Associations (LPGA, National Golf Course Owners Association, PGA Tour, USGA, and others involved in the annual Golf 20/20 Conference). The PGA is organized into 14 districts and 41 sections. To be elected to membership of the PGA, aspirant golf professionals (apprentices) and students go through three levels of education courses, written exams, simulation testing, seminars, and must pass the PGA Playing Ability Test. These men and women have the option to pursue the PGA education through self-study, by the use of accredited PGA Golf Management Universities (currently 18 universities in the United States offer a PGA Golf Management program),[28] or through an accelerated PGA Golf Management Program. PGA Reach is the charitable foundation of the PGA of America. The mission of PGA Reach is to positively impact the lives of youth, military, and diverse populations by enabling access to PGA professionals, PGA Sections and the game of golf.
